These tenets have served as the\\n\\nfoundation for our strong performance and progress.\\n\\nWe have seen Responsible Growth work in the relative\\n\\ncalm of 2015 to 2019, the pandemic tumult of 2020\\n\\nand 2021, and the infationary period of 2022. In each\\n\\nof these periods, our company benefted from our\\n\\nlong-term consistency and adherence to the tenets\\n\\nof Responsible Growth.\\n\\nResponsible Growth has served us well under\\n\\nvaried conditions\\n\\nThe core tenets of Responsible Growth have served our\\n\\ncompany and you, our shareholders, well during good\\n\\ntimes and stress.\\n\\nResponsible Growth served us well through the period\\n\\nfrom 2015 to 2019, when the economies of the\\n\\nworld settled into normalized growth rates and interest\\n\\nrates rose in the U.S. with the Federal Reserve’s\\n\\ntightening cycle.\\n\\nAs the pandemic hit in early 2020, a major economic\\n\\ncrisis ensued and your company performed well once\\n\\nagain, even as we met our clients’ borrowing demands,\\n\\nbuilt reserves, traded through uncertain markets, and\\n\\nhelped our employees, clients and our communities deal\\n\\nwith the pandemic and its afermath. Again, Responsible\\n\\nGrowth served us well.\\n\\nDuring 2022, the U.S. and the world continued to face\\n\\ncivil tensions from the pandemic and lockdowns, social\\n\\nand racial conficts, a war in Europe and energy supply\\n\\ndisruptions, and infation.\\n\\nResponsible Growth\\n\\n1.

The\\n\\nFederal Reserve started a tightening cycle in 2016, raising interest\\n\\nrates refecting the strength of the U.S. economy.

In the post-pandemic period\\n\\nwe have reestablished our organic\\n\\ngrowth engine.\\n\\nFor the entirety of the period from 2015 to 2022, we have seen\\n\\nthe stock price double; we have produced $185 billion in afer-tax\\n\\nearnings; and we have invested heavily in our franchise to better\\n\\nserve our customers and clients. Responsible Growth worked\\n\\nin all those environments and produced strong results on an\\n\\nenormous scale.\\n\\nA simple way to think about this is only four U.S. companies have\\n\\nearned more than $15 billion in GAAP afer-tax income in each of\\n\\nthese eight years. Your company is one of them.\\n\\nMore importantly, we are positioned well for the future. In the\\n\\npost-pandemic period we have reestablished our organic growth\\n\\nengine. We have delivered revenue growth, while controlling\\n\\nexpense, in a highly volatile environment. You will note increased\\n\\ncosts for 2019 to 2022 above. First, we had cost increases for\\n\\nspecial pandemic programs and to take care of our team. Then,\\n\\ninfation added to costs. But in the end, we have just delivered\\n\\nour sixth straight quarter of operating leverage in the fourth\\n\\nquarter of 2022.\\n\\nWe have strong credit quality, capital ratios in excess of\\n\\nconstantly increased regulatory minimums, a highly-respected\\n\\nbrand, high employee satisfaction and loyalty, and incredible\\n\\ncustomers we are honored to serve. We have built and improved\\n\\nupon digital capabilities across every line of business to serve\\n\\nthese customers, which embed the most efective capabilities\\n\\nof a fntech into the strength and stability of a well-regulated\\n\\ncompany.\\n\\nWhile we review and learn from the past, we don’t live there.\\n\\nWhat we are excited about is how our proven operating model\\n\\nsets us up for the future.

You will see more\\n\\nabout these leaders on pages 12 and 13.\\n\\nI especially want to recognize Lead Independent Director Lionel\\n\\nNowell, who was named as “Independent Director of the Year” by\\n\\nCorporate Board Member magazine. Lionel shares his perspective\\n\\non our company on page 11.\\n\\nWe welcomed José (Joe) E. Almeida, who joined your Board in\\n\\nSeptember. We also give our appreciation to David Yost, a director\\n\\nsince 2012, who is retiring due to age guidelines and will not\\n\\nstand for reelection at our annual shareholders’ meeting. We thank\\n\\nDave for his leadership, oversight, and prudent stewardship.\\n\\nThank you as well to my 217,000 teammates who join me every day\\n\\nat our company to fulfll our purpose of making fnancial lives better.\\n\\nIn a year that began with many of us once again working from home,\\n\\nwe are pleased to have our teammates back together, collaborating\\n\\nin person to serve our clients and deliver the full breadth of our\\n\\ncapabilities, as you’ll see highlighted throughout this Annual Report.\\n\\nA deeper look at 2022\\n\\nIn 2022, we earned $27.5 billion afer-tax, a decline from our\\n\\nrecord-level earnings in 2021, primarily due to increases in credit\\n\\ncosts due to the absence of reserve releases. We earned $3.19 per\\n\\ndiluted share, on $95 billion in revenue. Our pre-tax, pre-provision\\n\\nincome, which adjusts for the provision expense, was up 14%*\\n\\nfrom 2021, driven by organic growth across our lines of business,\\n\\nhigher interest rates, and prudent management of expenses. This\\n\\nhelped us achieve operating leverage in 2022.\\n\\nTotal assets declined slightly to $3.05 trillion driven by a decrease\\n\\nin deposits due to withdrawal of monetary accommodation. These\\n\\ndeposits remain at a healthy $1.9 trillion level. Deposits in the\\n\\nbanking industry are shrinking, the natural and intended outcome\\n\\nof the Federal Reserve’s monetary actions to fght infation.\\n\\nAt the same time, even as the economy weakened during 2022,\\n\\nloan demand increased as loans grew $67 billion to more than\\n\\n$1.04 trillion. Asset quality remained strong as net charge-ofs\\n\\nremained near the historically low range experienced in 2021.\\n\\nOverall, our balance sheet continued to be supported by high\\n\\nlevels of capital and liquidity, enabling us to continue to grow our\\n\\nbusiness with customers, while meeting additional regulatory\\n\\nrequirements, and repurchasing shares.\\n\\nRising infation also took its toll on the equities market. For the\\n\\nyear, our stock price decreased 24%, directionally in line with the\\n\\nS&P 500 and the broader bank index.\\n\\nThis followed a strong 2021 performance that saw our stock\\n\\noutperform and increase 47%. Book value per share and tangible\\n\\nbook value per share both increased in 2022.\\n\\nWe also addressed increased regulatory changes in our capital\\n\\nrequirements. Our common equity tier 1 capital (CET1) grew 5%\\n\\nin 2022 to more than $180 billion, and our CET1 ratio of 11.2%\\n\\nremained well above our new minimum requirements. Even while\\n\\ngrowing capital, our common dividend per share increased 10%\\n\\nfrom 2021 and, in the aggregate, in 2022 we returned $13.6 billion\\n\\nin capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\\n\\nOur frst use of our capital generation is to grow our company by\\n\\nsupporting our customers’ needs and pay our dividend. But in the\\n\\nend, we end up with more than we need for those purposes. Share\\n\\nrepurchases allow long-term holders to own more of our company.\\n\\nIn addition, we continued investments to enhance being a Great\\n\\nPlace to Work for teammates. We established a multi-faceted\\n\\napproach to workplace fexibility, provided free lunch for several\\n\\nmonths to help employees create informal connections and\\n\\nwelcome them back fully to work, and continued our competitive\\n\\npay packages to reward our employees for serving our clients and\\n\\ntargeted our eforts at building long careers at Bank of America.\\n\\nFor our communities and the broader needs of society, we also remain\\n\\nattentive to areas where we can direct the talent, innovation, and\\n\\nresources of our company and its role in capitalism. For example, we\\n\\nare working alongside our clients toward a clean energy, sustainable\\n\\nfuture. This is also why we invest in partners and programs in our\\n\\nlocal markets: to help create economic opportunity and prosperity in\\n\\nunderserved communities where the needs can be greatest.\\n\\nEuromoney named Bank of America\\n\\nthe World’s Best Bank for the second\\n\\ntime in fve years. We’re also pleased\\n\\nto be named America’s most “JUST”\\n\\nCompany by JUST Capital.\\n\\nFor all of this and more, Euromoney named Bank of America the\\n\\nWorld’s Best Bank for the second time in fve years. In announcing\\n\\nthis prestigious ranking, the publication stated: “In an increasingly\\n\\nvolatile and uncertain environment, Euromoney recognized Bank\\n\\nof America’s performance not only in retail banking, loan growth,\\n\\ncapital markets trading and wealth management, but also its\\n\\nbehavior as a corporate citizen.”\\n\\nWe’re also pleased to be named as America’s Most “JUST”\\n\\nCompany by JUST Capital. This ranking evaluates how companies\\n\\ninvest in employees, communities, and customers, along with other\\n\\nissues JUST Capital has identifed as important to Americans today.\\n\\nPre-tax, pre-provision income is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by adjusting consolidated pre-tax income to add back provision for credit loss. For\\n\\n2022 and 2021, reported pre-tax income was $31.0 billion and $34.0 billion, and reported provision (benefit) for credit losses was $2.5 billion and $(4.6) billion,\\n\\nresulting in pre-tax, pre-provision income of $33.5 billion and $29.4 billion.\\n\\n4 | BANK OF AMERICA 2022\\n\\nI am proud of all that your company, and our team, achieved in\\n\\n2022. We once again delivered both profts and purpose — the\\n\\ngenius of the AND as we call it — and we did it by delivering on\\n\\nthe tenets of Responsible Growth. Throughout this letter, I will\\n\\nshare with you examples about how we executed against each.\\n\\nThe rest of this report discusses that work in greater detail, and\\n\\nwe also make available a clear set of fnancial and non-fnancial\\n\\ndisclosures so you can see for yourself how we measure our\\n\\nprogress and determine where we have more work to do.\\n\\nWe are capitalists at Bank of America\\n\\nAt the core of the progress is our conviction that capitalism is\\n\\nembedded in how Responsible Growth delivers opportunity for our\\n\\nclients, our teammates, the communities we serve, and for you,\\n\\nour shareholders. I’ve sometimes been surprised to be asked —\\n\\nincluding at Congressional hearings — “Are you a capitalist?” Your\\n\\ncompany is one of the most proftable companies in the world,\\n\\nwhose purpose is to help our customers and clients live their\\n\\nfnancial lives, efectively helping them beneft in the capitalist\\n\\nsystem. Therefore, you might also fnd the question unusual. Of\\n\\ncourse, I answered, “Yes.”\\n\\nBut I understand the thoughts behind the question. I think the\\n\\nquestions and the concerns some may have about capitalism are\\n\\nabout opportunity. About whether companies are sharing profts\\n\\nor paying people fairly and equitably. At Bank of America, we look\\n\\nat it in this straightforward way: How can we rely on and help\\n\\nthe innovation and energy of capitalism to address the priorities\\n\\nof our communities and society AND beneft our shareholders?\\n\\nCapitalism provides the money, the creativity, and the expertise\\n\\nto solve the needs of society. We enable our customers to drive\\n\\ncapitalism. It is what we do.\\n\\n$27.5B\\n\\nnet income\\n\\n$3T\\n\\nbalance sheet\\n\\nWe once again delivered both\\n\\nprofts and purpose — the genius\\n\\nof the AND as we call it — and we\\n\\ndid it by delivering on the tenets of\\n\\nResponsible Growth.\\n\\nThroughout this report we provide details about how we do this:\\n\\nHow we help transmit the economy by lending, investing, and\\n\\nworking alongside our clients to help them succeed. About all we\\n\\ndo to support our teammates and be a Great Place to Work for\\n\\nthem. The many ways we partner in local markets to help support\\n\\ncommunity priorities. And, at the same time, How we deliver for\\n\\nyou, our shareholders.\\n\\nAll these activities refect our view that capitalism creates\\n\\nopportunity — for our customers and clients at every stage of\\n\\ntheir progress; for our teammates to advance their careers at\\n\\nBank of America and support their families; for those in our local\\n\\ncommunities who may need help accessing our economic system\\n\\nto achieve their own goals; and for our millions of investors, a\\n\\nchance to share in our success through their ownership.\\n\\nTo do this, we align our day-to-day business activities to the work.\\n\\nWe bring our $3 trillion balance sheet to the task. We bring our\\n\\n$273 billion in equity. We bring our capital markets and lending\\n\\ncapabilities, raising trillions for our clients. We bring the invested\\n\\nassets of our wealth management clients. Of course, we also\\n\\nbring the nearly $360 million of philanthropy we commit.

In 2022, we\\n\\nacquired new clients and deepened our relationships with existing\\n\\nones. The strongest underlying evidence of winning in the\\n\\nmarketplace is through market share, as illustrated by organic\\n\\ngrowth activity with our clients.\\n\\nWe drive Responsible Growth through our eight lines of business.\\n\\nOur client teams deliver the unique capabilities and oferings of\\n\\neach business to each client. We also focus in each market on\\n\\nbringing the entire company to every customer or client. We track\\n\\nhow well we deliver these integrated capabilities by the number of\\n\\nclient referrals between our lines of business in our local markets.\\n\\nIn 2022, we saw more than 7.5 million total referrals among\\n\\nour operating units. I want to thank our 97 market presidents\\n\\nacross the U.S. and the nearly 30 country executives around the\\n\\nglobe who serve as chief executive for Bank of America in their\\n\\nmarkets. They lead an integrated team to help us deliver one\\n\\ncompany for clients, teammates, you, our shareholders, and the\\n\\nbroader communities served by your company. In this report on\\n\\npage 32, you will see how that comes to life in just one of these\\n\\ncommunities through our local leadership.\\n\\nIn 2022, we saw more than\\n\\n7.5 million total referrals among\\n\\nour operating units.\\n\\nIn 2022, we helped consumer clients to open a record one million\\n\\nnet new checking accounts. We also opened 465,000 Consumer\\n\\n6 | BANK OF AMERICA 2022\\n\\nInvestment accounts through our online investment platform,\\n\\nMerrill Edge, resulting in $28 billion in net client fows. And we\\n\\nadded more than a million new consumer credit card accounts\\n\\nin three of the four quarters in 2022.\\n\\nPreferred Rewards — our fagship loyalty program that\\n\\nrecognizes and rewards clients for doing business with us across\\n\\nall products — recorded another strong year of growth, with\\n\\n10.2 million total clients enrolled. This represents a 9% year-overyear increase, with the program retaining its best-in-class 99%\\n\\nannualized membership retention rate.\\n\\nSmall business owners benefted from Bank of America’s products,\\n\\nscale and expertise at our retail fnancial centers across the U.S. —\\n\\nincluding Business Advantage specialists in more than 2,600 fnancial\\n\\ncenters, as well as our expansive ATM network, and access to local\\n\\nclient professionals available to discuss their business priorities. We\\n\\nalso are available to serve our small business clients digitally with the\\n\\nlatest videoconferencing, chat and phone technology. Thanks to all\\n\\nof this and more, we continue to maintain our position among the\\n\\nnation’s largest small business lenders, ending 2022 with $36 billion\\n\\nin total outstanding loans under $1 million and a 5% increase in\\n\\nSmall Business checking accounts. And these small business clients\\n\\nhave entrusted us with managing approximately $175 billion of\\n\\ndeposits to pay their employees and build their businesses.\\n\\nOur Merchant Services platform also recorded a strong year\\n\\nsupporting fnancial solutions for merchants, adding new clients and\\n\\nvolume while achieving a #1 client experience rating from J.D. Power.\\n\\nOur wealth management business is comprised of Merrill and The\\n\\nPrivate Bank, which supported clients through last year’s turbulent\\n\\nmarkets. The business added nearly 28,000 net new relationships\\n\\nas well as more than 800 wealth advisors in the second half of\\n\\nthe year. This aided in gathering $87 billion in client fows for\\n\\nwealth management clients. Together, the team helped clients\\n\\nopen more than 119,000 new bank accounts in 2022. And we saw\\n\\naverage loan and lease growth of 10% year-over-year — the 51st\\n\\nconsecutive quarter of growth as we continue to deliver our full\\n\\nsuite of products and services in a way that sets us apart from\\n\\ncompetitors and meets client needs.\\n\\nIn our Global Banking business, serving commercial and corporate\\n\\nclients, we added more than 1,110 clients to the company in\\n\\n2022 and grew average loans and leases 14% year-over-year to\\n\\n$375 billion. We also delivered $10.4 billion in Global Transaction\\n\\nServices revenue, up 38% over 2021. We moved up to #3 in the\\n\\ninvestment banking fees market share worldwide.\\n\\nOur Global Markets business once again had a very strong year\\n\\ndespite market volatility. The team grew year-over-year sales and\\n\\ntrading revenue by 9%, and had the highest full-year tally since\\n\\n2010. This included investment in our macro trading business,\\n\\nwhich had revenues that were up 38% for the year. Overall Global\\n\\nMarkets average trading-related assets were up 9% and average\\n\\nloans of $117 billion increased 28%.\\n\\nResponsible Growth means growing\\n\\nwith a focus on the customer — and\\n\\nthat means that our products and\\n\\nservices must evolve in line with our\\n\\nclients’ unique fnancial needs.\\n\\nGrow with a customer focus.

These active users sent and\\n\\nreceived 273 million transfers worth $81 billion, up 25% and 24%\\n\\nyear-over-year, respectively. Zelle-sent transactions exceed checks\\n\\nwritten by our consumers. This shows our customers’ preference\\n\\nfor digital convenience. This allows us to see strong customer scores\\n\\nand loyalty, while reducing our costs of operation in our consumer\\n\\nbusiness as a percentage of deposits to 117 basis points.\\n\\nOur wealth clients also expect digital innovation, and we are\\n\\nproviding it. For example:\\n\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, Erica interactions in the Merrill\\n\\nWealth Management business increased 23% and Zelle\\n\\ntransactions by Private Bank clients increased 39%.\\n\\nMerrill clients are 82% digitally active while our Private Bank\\n\\nclients are now 86% digitally active — new highs for both.\\n\\nDigital check deposit rates for Merrill and Private Bank clients\\n\\nstand at 75% and 76%, respectively.\\n\\nMerrill now has 77% of households enrolled in eDelivery, with\\n\\n223,000 planning reports generated — up 26% from the end of\\n\\nthe previous year.\\n\\nMerrill Lynch advisors sent 1.4 million secure messages to our\\n\\nclients in the fourth quarter of 2022 alone.\\n\\nOur commercial clients also continue to adopt our easy-to-use\\n\\nCashPro app, and along with that use, we’re seeing an increasing\\n\\npercentage of credit documents uploaded digitally, saving clients\\n\\ntime. As of late 2022, 75% of clients are digitally active on the\\n\\nCashPro and BA360 platforms across commercial, corporate, and\\n\\nbusiness banking. The fourth quarter of 2022 saw record quarterly\\n\\nCashPro App engagement, with active users increasing 25% and\\n\\nsign-ins increasing 50%, in turn driving a record 40% increase in\\n\\nquarterly CashPro App payment approvals with a value of $186\\n\\nbillion. We know we can increase these award-wining capabilities\\n\\neven more, driven by client demand.\\n\\n56M\\n\\nverifed digital\\n\\nusers in 2022\\n\\n11.6B\\n\\ndigital logins\\n\\nin 2022\\n\\nThe case for continued development of our digital platforms\\n\\nis simple: clients tell us they clearly appreciate the value\\n\\nand convenience it provides — so we will continue to provide\\n\\nand expand it.\\n\\nWe continue to take the steps necessary to fully digitally enable\\n\\nall products to drive growth and maximize the client experience.\\n\\nThat’s why we invested $3.6 billion in 2022 for new technology\\n\\ninitiatives, to build a powerful, more secure, and scalable\\n\\ntechnology platform with market-leading capabilities. That sum\\n\\nis up from 2021 and is expected to be higher again in 2023.\\n\\nAnd through continuous investment we have spent more than\\n\\n$30 billion over the past decade on new technology initiatives.\\n\\nBANK OF AMERICA 2022\\n\\n| 7\\n\\ncompany performance\\n\\nThis work beneftted from the important insights and guidance\\n\\nfrom our National Community Advisory Council (NCAC), a group\\n\\nof external advisors, analysts, and consumer advocates that we\\n\\nestablished 17 years ago. The NCAC provides important external\\n\\nperspective to help us understand, design, and deliver products\\n\\nto help meet the needs of our communities — particularly those\\n\\nin the low- to moderate-income sphere.\\n\\nAt the same time, we also continued to focus on delivering\\n\\nexpert support and guidance across our high-touch physical\\n\\nnetwork, opening 58 new fnancial centers, and renovating 784\\n\\nmore in 2022. We ended the year with 3,900 fnancial centers\\n\\nand 15,500 ATMs. This network also includes our phone, ofces,\\n\\nand chat capabilities. We are pleased by the results in our new\\n\\nmarkets, where we are growing from no fnancial centers there\\n\\nto become top 10 or above in deposit market share in just a\\n\\nfew years.\\n\\nTogether, our combined high-tech and high-touch approach to\\n\\nserving clients has led to record-high levels of customer satisfaction\\n\\nfor Bank of America in 2022 and, in turn, contributed to our growth.\\n\\nSimply put, more satisfed clients do more business with us.\\n\\nAnother recent example of our customer-focus is the continued\\n\\nevolution of our overdraf services and solutions — work that had\\n\\nbeen underway for more than a dozen years to reduce clients’\\n\\nreliance on overdrafs and provide alternatives to help clients\\n\\nmanage their deposit accounts and avoid fees. You can see in our\\n\\nRetail Banking update on page 16 that these fees are down over\\n\\n90% from 2009.\\n\\nWe believe that these fees are not sustainable for a good customer\\n\\nrelationship, and by eliminating them we are able to increase\\n\\nsatisfaction and deepen relationships to create a more stable\\n\\nsource of revenues, while reducing costs for our company.\\n\\nGrow within our risk framework. The third tenet of\\n\\nResponsible Growth is to grow within our well-managed risk\\n\\nframework — a framework that allowed us to be a source of\\n\\nstrength to clients during the health crisis and that has continued\\n\\nto allow us to grow during the current volatile market environment.\\n\\nOur discipline around risk has us well-prepared for a severe\\n\\neconomic stress scenario, as illustrated by Bank of America having\\n\\nthe lowest stressed credit loss rates among major banks in nine\\n\\nout of the past 10 CCAR exams conducted by the Federal Reserve\\n\\nBoard. As we cited earlier, credit quality continues to be better\\n\\nthan 2019, which was the last year before the pandemic and\\n\\nrepresented a very strong year for credit at banks.\\n\\nIn addition to being efective, our risk management is also\\n\\nagile — when regulatory capital ratio requirements for banks\\n\\nchanged with little advance notice in 2022, we made moves so\\n\\nthat we had a bufer to those requirements quickly. Importantly,\\n\\nwe did that as we continued to support clients, return capital to\\n\\nshareholders, and strengthen our strong balance sheet.\\n\\nContinued quarterly operating leverage¹ streak in 2022\\n\\n29%\\n\\n22%\\n\\n3Q19-2Q21\\n\\nBreak in operating\\n\\nleverage streak\\n\\n21%\\n\\n12%\\n\\n8%\\n\\n8%\\n\\n5%\\n\\n3%\\n\\n1Q\\n\\n15\\n\\n2Q\\n\\n3Q\\n\\n4Q\\n\\n8%\\n\\n6%\\n\\n6%\\n\\n4%\\n\\n3%\\n\\n1Q\\n\\n16\\n\\n2Q\\n\\n7% 7%\\n\\n5%\\n\\n4%\\n\\n6%\\n\\n4%\\n\\n4%\\n\\n2%\\n\\n3Q\\n\\n4Q\\n\\n1Q\\n\\n17\\n\\n2Q\\n\\n3Q\\n\\n4Q\\n\\n1Q\\n\\n18\\n\\n2Q\\n\\n3Q\\n\\n4Q\\n\\n1Q\\n\\n19\\n\\n2Q\\n\\n3%\\n\\n4%\\n\\n2%\\n\\n3Q\\n\\n21\\n\\n4Q\\n\\n1Q\\n\\n22\\n\\n2Q\\n\\n3Q\\n\\n4Q\\n\\nNote: Amounts may not total due to rounding.\\n\\n1\\n\\nOperating leverage is calculated as the year-over-year percentage change in revenue, net of interest expense, less the percentage change in noninterest expense.\\n\\n8 | BANK OF AMERICA 2022\\n\\nGrow in a sustainable manner. Responsible Growth requires\\n\\nus to grow in a sustainable manner. This has three components.\\n\\nFirst, we drive Operational Excellence (OpEx). This allows us to\\n\\ncreate savings, which we can then reinvest — in our capabilities,\\n\\nour teammates, our communities and in capital returns to\\n\\nshareholders. Second, we want to be a Great Place to Work for our\\n\\nteammates. This provides us a competitive edge to attract the\\n\\nbest new teammates to serve our clients and retain them once\\n\\nthey’ve joined the team. Third, we share our success so we can\\n\\nsupport the communities in which we work and live and help to\\n\\naddress the biggest challenges facing communities today.\\n\\nDriving Operational Excellence. OpEx is how we create the\\n\\nmeans to reduce costs by striving to eliminate inefciencies in our\\n\\nprocesses across our platform and reinvest savings into the things\\n\\nthat are important to us: our team, our capabilities, our client\\n\\nexperience, our communities, and our shareholders.\\n\\nBy pursuing OpEx, we drive continuous improvement, reduce risk,\\n\\nand identify faster, simpler, and more efcient ways of working\\n\\nand serving our clients.\\n\\nIn 2022, our fourth quarter operating leverage was 6%. Simply put,\\n\\noperating leverage is the percentage growth in revenue minus the\\n\\npercent growth in expenses. By looking for continuous process\\n\\nimprovements and savings through OpEx, we have delivered\\n\\noperating leverage for the past six consecutive quarters — picking\\n\\nback up on the 18-quarter streak we had developed prior to the\\n\\npandemic-driven economic slowdown.\\n\\nIn Retail Banking, OpEx and a more digitized customer base helped\\n\\npay for investments that allowed us to improve that business’s\\n\\nefciency ratio to 47% in the most recent quarter, an impressive\\n\\n600 basis point improvement over the year-ago fourth quarter.\\n\\nAcross the company, we have implemented more than 12,000\\n\\nemployee-sourced suggestions since 2014 to simplify our work and\\n\\ncreate greater efciency. In addition to making it easier to serve\\n\\nour clients, these ideas have resulted in nearly $5 billion in expense\\n\\nsavings and 13 million hours of capacity saved. Whatever challenges\\n\\nthe future may hold, your company’s focus on OpEx will help deliver\\n\\nfor clients while investing in the future of our people, communities\\n\\nand driving great returns to you, our shareholders. In 2022, our\\n\\nexpenses were $61 billion, which is more than $10 billion lower than\\n\\na decade ago.\\n\\nCentral to driving Responsible\\n\\nGrowth is being a Great Place to\\n\\nWork for our teammates.

This means that any employee who\\n\\nworks full-time for our company makes at least ~$46,000 per year\\n\\nas well as some of the most comprehensive benefts available.\\n\\nIn addition to normal merit, we delivered a mid-year increase to\\n\\nannual base salaries for all U.S. employees who currently receive\\n\\nannual total compensation below $100,000 and have been\\n\\nemployed with the company since 2021 or earlier. The percentage\\n\\nincrease for eligible employees ranged from 3% to 7%, increasing\\n\\nwith years of service.\\n\\nIn recognition of the important achievements made by our\\n\\nemployees in 2022, our Management Team, Board of Directors\\n\\nand I once again recognized teammates with our Sharing Success\\n\\ncompensation award. This is the sixth time teammates will receive\\n\\nthis award, totaling more than $4 billion since its inception.\\n\\nApproximately 96% of our teammates received an award this year,\\n\\nwith the vast majority receiving it in the form of Bank of America\\n\\nstock to help them share in our long-term success.\\n\\nWe also launched a new sabbatical program for employees\\n\\ncelebrating milestones of 15 years or more beginning in 2023,\\n\\nand doubled the number of confdential, face-to-face counseling\\n\\nsessions available through our Employee Assistance Program.\\n\\nWe increased our childcare benefts, which provide eligible\\n\\nemployees making less than $100,000 per year a reimbursement\\n\\nof up to $275 a month per child for the cost of childcare.\\n\\nWe also continued to have no, or below our cost, increases in\\n\\nhealth benefts for most of our teammates to help them care for\\n\\ntheir families.\\n\\nBANK OF AMERICA 2022\\n\\n| 9\\n\\ncompany performance\\n\\nWe continue to recruit, develop, and retain a diverse and inclusive\\n\\nworkplace.

Our diversity and inclusion (D&I) policies drive transparency,\\n\\naccountability, and continued progress while encouraging all\\n\\nteammates to bring their full and authentic selves to work each\\n\\nday. Third parties validate our equal pay for equal work eforts,\\n\\nand we continue to survey our teammates annually on how we are\\n\\ndoing in the D&I space. As in recent years, the 2022 employee\\n\\nsurvey D&I index scores remained high.\\n\\nSharing our success. At Bank of America, sharing success\\n\\nincludes giving and volunteering, as well as helping to address\\n\\nissues afecting clients and communities. When our communities\\n\\nfare well, we fare well, and our brand refects it.\\n\\nIn 2022, we made nearly $360 million in philanthropic investments\\n\\nto strengthen our communities. Our teammates also donated\\n\\nmoney, as well as their time, to share success. Charitable giving by\\n\\nour teammates in 2022, combined with matching gifs from Bank\\n\\nof America, totaled more than $65 million. Our teammates also\\n\\nreported nearly two million volunteer hours for the year. I am proud to\\n\\nshare this proof of their commitment to our communities with you.\\n\\nTo help support health and safety, and address food insecurity in\\n\\nour local markets, we ran two campaigns to encourage employees\\n\\nto get vaccinated and/or boosted against COVID-19 and the fu,\\n\\ndonating to hunger relief organizations for each employee who\\n\\ntook those actions. Combined, the campaigns donated more\\n\\nthan $18 million for hunger organizations across the country.\\n\\nSince 2015 we have donated nearly $184 million toward hunger\\n\\nrelief eforts.\\n\\nWe also create opportunity in our communities through\\n\\nemployment. We are in our second commitment to hire 10,000\\n\\nteammates from low- and moderate-income communities,\\n\\nhaving completed the frst in three years versus the fve pledged.\\n\\nSimilarly, to recognize our service men and women, we have\\n\\nhired over 15,000 veterans in the last eight years. We work\\n\\nwith other companies to expand the principles of skills-based\\n\\nhiring to large companies. This gives an employee a great\\n\\nstart with great benefts.\\n\\n10 | BANK OF AMERICA 2022\\n\\nWe continue to help drive sustainability through our work with\\n\\nclients to help them transition to a secure, low-carbon economy. We\\n\\nare committed to helping facilitate that just energy transition, with\\n\\nclean energy that is afordable, sustainable and secure. That’s why\\n\\nin 2020 we set a goal to mobilize and deploy $1.5 trillion by 2030\\n\\nto advance the sustainable development goals (SDGs) 193 countries\\n\\nagreed to in 2015, with $1 trillion of that focused on helping our\\n\\nclients transition to a low-carbon future. From 2021 through 2022,\\n\\nwe mobilized and deployed a cumulative total of $410 billion in\\n\\nsustainable fnance, with more than $235 billion of that focused\\n\\non helping drive afordable clean energy and related priorities. At\\n\\nthe same time, we are helping catalyze eforts globally by playing a\\n\\nlead role in multiple global organizations to give private companies\\n\\nfrom all sectors the opportunity to exchange ideas and consider\\n\\ntransactions and investments that can help accelerate the transition.\\n\\nOur approach to sustainable fnance is to help our clients make the\\n\\ntransition they seek. It is great business and great for society. For\\n\\nmore, see page 38.\\n\\nWe issued our third Equality Progress Sustainability Bond for\\n\\n$2 billion. The use of proceeds from the bond ofering is designed\\n\\nto advance racial and gender equality, economic opportunity, and\\n\\nenvironmental sustainability.\\n\\nWe also created additional opportunity for diverse and women\\n\\nentrepreneurs and business owners.\\n\\nOver the last few years, we have invested in 23 minority depository\\n\\ninstitutions. We also have helped seed more than 130 private equity\\n\\nfunds run by women and diverse private equity entrepreneurs.\\n\\nThese private equity funds have funded more than 1,000 operating\\n\\ncompanies owned by like cohorts. We also recognize the value to\\n\\nour business — and to society — of supply chain diversity. In 2022,\\n\\napproximately $2 billion of our nearly $19 billion in annual spend\\n\\nwas with diverse suppliers. You can read more about how we are\\n\\ninvesting in diverse entrepreneurs on page 36.\\n\\nMeasuring our positive impact at home and around the\\n\\nworld — how capitalism delivers\\n\\nI was asked by a teammate with a college-age daughter how we\\n\\nmight be more convincing that capitalism is doing what society\\n\\nwants from it. My response: We don’t leave it to interpretation,\\n\\nwe disclose what we do for all to see. What we show in the\\n\\nmetrics in this report is the progress we are making as well as the\\n\\nalignment to what society wants from capitalism — to produce\\n\\nprofts and purpose. That perpetual motion machine of capitalism\\n\\ncan continuously invest in progress on the goals described\\n\\nbelow. Charity is wonderful, but it doesn’t provide enough money.\\n\\nGovernments are large spenders, but they are short on cash and\\n\\nrun huge defcits, so they really don’t have the money to drive\\n\\nsustained progress. Government policies shif and therefore\\n\\nlong-term change is hard to achieve. Companies around the world,\\n\\nwhen aligned to the tasks generate activity that dwarfs the eforts\\n\\nof other sectors. It is sustained by the profts, which draw more\\n\\ncapital. So the straightforward answer to the teammate was — if\\n\\nwe want to be successful at what society wants, we should all\\n\\ncheer capitalism on.\\n\\nHowever, it is important to measure progress to prove capitalism\\n\\nis working. In the U.S. and globally, companies can track their\\n\\nperformance in areas that include equality of opportunity,\\n\\nafordable housing, prosperity, access to clean water, sustainable,\\n\\nclean, secure energy, and other priorities.\\n\\nexpressing diferent views on what is the right disclosure or action.\\n\\nWe encourage you to review our SCMs and all the other disclosures\\n\\nwe reference in this Annual Report and proxy statement. We don’t\\n\\nneed to spend more of your money on inconsistent and redundant\\n\\nstandards; we need to keep driving our performance.\\n\\nWe do so through reporting a set of universal Stakeholder Capitalism\\n\\nMetrics (SCM). The SCMs span the breadth of global industry, giving\\n\\na consistent framework to measure and disclose how companies\\n\\nare addressing societal priorities and the SDGs through their\\n\\nbusiness activities and operations. Nearly 200 companies around\\n\\nthe world have committed to reporting SCMs — and about 140\\n\\nhave already begun to do so.

As part\\n\\nof delegating to ISS, clients may, at their discretion, choose among the\\n\\nISS Benchmark, ISS Socially Responsible Investing, and ISS Catholic\\n\\nproxy voting guidelines. Managed Account Advisors (MAA) and Merrill\\n\\nLynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith (MLPF&S) perform due diligence on ISS\\n\\nto determine that it has the capacity and competency to adequately\\n\\nanalyze proxy issues and can make such voting recommendations in\\n\\nan impartial manner and in the best interests of clients. For matters\\n\\nover which ISS has a conflict or is otherwise unable to vote (called\\n\\nSpecified Investments), the proxy committee of MAA or MLPF&S, as\\n\\napplicable, will have the authority to vote proxies in accordance with\\n\\nits proxy voting policies and procedures. MAA or MLPF&S does not\\n\\nassume proxy voting authority for securities except with respect to\\n\\nSpecified Investments. For proxies neither covered by ISS nor included\\n\\nas Specified Investments, the client will retain the right to vote those\\n\\nproxies. Generally, Bank of America The Private Bank (The Private\\n\\nBank) clients delegate authority to The Private Bank to vote proxies\\n\\non their behalf. The Private Bank has a fiduciary focused proxy voting\\n\\npolicy and custom guidelines and employs Glass Lewis to execute the\\n\\nvotes. For investment management accounts where The Private Bank\\n\\nis not the trustee or other named fiduciary, clients may delegate proxy\\n\\nauthority directly to Glass Lewis (or other proxy advisor as determined\\n\\nby The Private Bank) via their investment advisory agreement, as\\n\\ndescribed above.

When used in\\n\\nthis report, “Bank of America,” “the Corporation,” “we,” “us”\\n\\nand “our” may refer to Bank of America Corporation individually,\\n\\nBank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of\\n\\nBank of America Corporation’s subsidiaries or affiliates. Our\\n\\nBank of America 2022 73\\n\\nprincipal executive offices are located in Charlotte, North\\n\\nCarolina. Through our various bank and nonbank subsidiaries\\n\\nthroughout the U.S. and in international markets, we provide a\\n\\ndiversified range of banking and nonbank financial services and\\n\\nproducts through four business segments: Consumer Banking,\\n\\nGlobal Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM), Global\\n\\nBanking and Global Markets, with the remaining operations\\n\\nrecorded in All Other. We operate our banking activities primarily\\n\\nunder the Bank of America, National Association (Bank of\\n\\nAmerica, N.A. or BANA) charter. At December 31, 2022, the\\n\\nCorporation had $3.1 trillion in assets and a headcount of\\n\\napproximately 217,000 employees.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2022, we served clients through\\n\\noperations across the U.S., its territories and more than 35\\n\\ncountries. Our retail banking footprint covers all major markets\\n\\nin the U.S., and we serve approximately 67 million consumer\\n\\nand small business clients with approximately 3,900 retail\\n\\nfinancial centers, approximately 16,000 ATMs, and leading\\n\\ndigital banking platforms (www.bankofamerica.com) with\\n\\napproximately 44 million active users, including approximately\\n\\n35 million active mobile users. We offer industry-leading support\\n\\nto approximately three million small business households. Our\\n\\nGWIM businesses, with client balances of $3.4 trillion, provide\\n\\ntailored solutions to meet client needs through a full set of\\n\\ninvestment management, brokerage, banking, trust and\\n\\nretirement products. We are a global leader in corporate and\\n\\ninvestment banking and trading across a broad range of asset\\n\\nclasses serving corporations, governments, institutions and\\n\\nindividuals around the world.\\n\\nRecent Developments\\n\\nCapital Management\\n\\nOn February 1, 2023, the Corporation’s Board of Directors (the\\n\\nBoard) declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.22\\n\\nper share, payable on March 31, 2023 to shareholders of\\n\\nrecord as of March 3, 2023.\\n\\nFor more information on our capital resources, see Capital\\n\\nManagement on page 96.\\n\\nChanges in U.S. Tax Law\\n\\nOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction\\n\\nAct of 2022, which contained a number of tax-related\\n\\nprovisions. The tax changes included the extension and\\n\\nexpansion of renewable energy tax credit programs, the\\n\\nestablishment of a new 15 percent alternative minimum tax\\n\\n(AMT) on adjusted financial statement income for large\\n\\ncorporations and a one percent excise tax on stock\\n\\nrepurchases. For more information, see Financial Highlights –\\n\\nIncome Tax Expense on page 76.\\n\\nRussia/Ukraine Conflict\\n\\nDue to the Russia/Ukraine conflict, there has been significant\\n\\nvolatility in financial and commodities markets, and multiple\\n\\njurisdictions have implemented various economic sanctions. At\\n\\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, our direct net country exposure\\n\\nto Russia was $443 million and $733 million, primarily\\n\\nconsisting of outstanding loans and leases totaling $391 million\\n\\nand $686 million, and our net country exposure to Ukraine was\\n\\nnot significant. While the Corporation’s direct exposure to\\n\\nRussia is limited, the potential duration, course and impact of\\n\\nthe Russia/Ukraine conflict remain uncertain and could\\n\\nadversely affect macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions,\\n\\nwhich could negatively impact the Corporation\\'s businesses,\\n\\nresults of operations and financial position. For more\\n\\n74 Bank of America 2022\\n\\ninformation on the risks related to the Russia/Ukraine conflict,\\n\\nsee the Market, Credit and Geopolitical sections in Item 1A.\\n\\nRisk Factors of our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\nLIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates\\n\\nAfter December 31, 2021, ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA)\\n\\nceased publishing British Pound Sterling (GBP), Euro, Swiss\\n\\nFranc, and Japanese Yen (JPY) London Interbank Offered Rate\\n\\n(LIBOR) settings and one-week and two-month U.S. dollar (USD)\\n\\nLIBOR settings, subject to the continued publication of certain\\n\\nnon-representative LIBOR settings based on a modified\\n\\ncalculation (i.e., on a “synthetic” basis). The remaining USD\\n\\nLIBOR settings (i.e., overnight, one month, three month, six\\n\\nmonth and 12 month) will cease or become non-representative\\n\\nimmediately after June 30, 2023, although the Financial\\n\\nConduct Authority (FCA) has issued a consultation seeking views\\n\\non whether to compel publication of the one-month, three-month\\n\\nand six-month USD LIBOR settings on a “synthetic” basis for a\\n\\nshort time after June 30, 2023 (i.e., through September 30,\\n\\n2024). Separately, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the\\n\\nComptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance\\n\\nCorporation (FDIC) issued supervisory guidance encouraging\\n\\nbanks to cease entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR\\n\\nas a reference rate by December 31, 2021, subject to certain\\n\\nregulatory-approved exceptions (USD LIBOR Guidance).\\n\\nAs a result, a major transition has been and continues to be\\n\\nin progress in the global financial markets with respect to the\\n\\nreplacement of Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs). This has been\\n\\nand continues to be a complex process impacting a variety of\\n\\nour businesses and operations. IBORs have historically been\\n\\nused in many of the Corporation’s products and contracts,\\n\\nincluding derivatives, consumer and commercial loans,\\n\\nmortgages, floating-rate notes and other adjustable-rate\\n\\nproducts and financial instruments. In response, the\\n\\nCorporation established an enterprise-wide IBOR transition\\n\\nprogram, with active involvement of senior management and\\n\\nregular reports to the Management Risk Committee (MRC) and\\n\\nEnterprise Risk Committee (ERC). The program continues to\\n\\ndrive the Corporation\\'s industry and regulatory engagement,\\n\\nclient and financial contract changes, internal and external\\n\\ncommunications, technology and operations modifications,\\n\\nincluding updates to its operational models, systems and\\n\\nprocesses, introduction of new products, migration of existing\\n\\nclients, and program strategy and governance.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Corporation transitioned or\\n\\notherwise addressed IBOR-based products and contracts\\n\\nreferencing the rates that ceased or became non-representative\\n\\nafter December 31, 2021, including LIBOR-linked commercial\\n\\nloans, LIBOR-based adjustable-rate consumer mortgages,\\n\\nLIBOR-linked derivatives and interdealer trading of certain USD\\n\\nLIBOR and other interest rate swaps, and related hedging\\n\\narrangements. Additionally, in accordance with the USD LIBOR\\n\\nGuidance, the Corporation has ceased entering into new\\n\\ncontracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate, subject to\\n\\nlimited exceptions, including those consistent with supervisory\\n\\nguidance.\\n\\nThe Corporation launched capabilities and services to\\n\\nsupport the issuance of and trading in products indexed to\\n\\nvarious alternative reference rates (ARRs) and developed\\n\\nemployee training programs as well as other internal and\\n\\nexternal sources of information on the various challenges and\\n\\nopportunities that the replacement of IBORs has presented and\\n\\ncontinues to present. The Corporation continues to monitor a\\n\\nvariety of market scenarios as part of its transition efforts,\\n\\nincluding risks associated with insufficient preparation by\\n\\nindividual market participants or the overall market ecosystem,\\n\\nability of market participants to meet regulatory and industrywide recommended milestones, and access and demand by\\n\\nclients and market participants to liquidity in certain products,\\n\\nincluding LIBOR products.\\n\\nWith respect to the transition of LIBOR products referencing\\n\\nUSD LIBOR settings ceasing or becoming non-representative as\\n\\nof June 30, 2023, a significant majority of the Corporation’s\\n\\nnotional contractual exposure to such LIBOR settings, of which\\n\\nthe significant majority is derivatives contracts, have been\\n\\nremediated (i.e., updated to include fallback provisions to ARRs\\n\\nbased on market-driven protocols, regulatory guidance and\\n\\nindustry-recommended fallback provisions and related\\n\\nmechanisms), and the Corporation is continuing to remediate\\n\\nthe remaining USD LIBOR exposure. For example, during the\\n\\nfirst half of 2023, certain central counterparties (CCPs) expect\\n\\nto complete processes to convert outstanding USD LIBORcleared derivatives to ARR positions. The remaining exposure, a\\n\\nmajority of which is made up of derivatives and commercial\\n\\nloans and which represents a small minority of outstanding USD\\n\\nLIBOR notional contractual exposure of the Corporation, requires\\n\\nactive dialogue with clients to modify the contracts. For any\\n\\nresidual exposures after June 2023 that continue to have no\\n\\nfallback provisions, the Corporation continues to assess and\\n\\nplans to leverage relevant contractual and statutory solutions,\\n\\nincluding the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act in the U.S. (as\\n\\nimplemented by the Federal Reserve) and “synthetic” USD\\n\\nLIBOR (if the FCA compels such publication), to transition such\\n\\nexposure.\\n\\nWhile there remain risks to the Corporation associated with\\n\\nthe transition from IBORs (as discussed under Item 1A. Risk\\n\\nFactors of our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K), such risks\\n\\nhave been monitored and, where applicable, managed through\\n\\nthe Corporation’s efforts and dedicated operational resources to\\n\\ndate. In the Corporation’s view, the potential likelihood and/or\\n\\nimpact of transition-related risks has lessened over time, and\\n\\nthe Corporation anticipates it has devoted appropriate\\n\\nresources to remaining transition efforts and will be able to\\n\\ncontinue to appropriately monitor and manage such risks as the\\n\\ntransition process continues. The Corporation expects\\n\\ntransition-related risks to further diminish as certain market\\n\\ndevelopments occur prior to June 30, 2023.\\n\\nThe Corporation has implemented regulatory, tax and\\n\\naccounting changes and continues to monitor current and\\n\\npotential impacts of the transition, including Internal Revenue\\n\\nService tax regulations and guidance and Financial Accounting\\n\\nStandards Board guidance. In addition, the Corporation has\\n\\nengaged impacted clients in connection with the transition by\\n\\nproviding education on ARRs and the timing of transition events.\\n\\nThe Corporation is also working actively with global regulators,\\n\\nindustry working groups and trade associations.\\n\\nFor more information on the expected replacement of LIBOR\\n\\nand other benchmark rates, see Item 1A.

Net interest yield on a fully taxableequivalent (FTE) basis increased 30 basis points (bps) to 1.96\\n\\npercent for 2022. The increase was primarily driven by benefits\\n\\nfrom higher interest rates, including lower premium amortization\\n\\nexpense, and loan growth, partially offset by a lower amount of\\n\\naccelerated net capitalized loan fees due to Paycheck Protection\\n\\nProgram (PPP) loan forgiveness, which primarily occurred in\\n\\n2021.

The following highlights the significant\\n\\nchanges.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nService charges decreased $1.1 billion primarily driven by\\n\\nthe impact of non-sufficient funds and overdraft policy\\n\\nchanges as well as lower treasury service charges.\\n\\nInvestment and brokerage services decreased $789 million\\n\\nprimarily driven by lower market valuations and declines in\\n\\nassets under management (AUM) pricing, partially offset by\\n\\npositive AUM flows.\\n\\nInvestment banking fees decreased $4.1 billion primarily\\n\\ndriven by a decline in demand resulting in lower equity and\\n\\ndebt issuance fees and lower advisory fees.\\n\\nMarket making and similar activities increased $3.4 billion\\n\\nprimarily driven by improved performance across macro\\n\\nproducts in fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC)\\n\\nand by the impact of higher interest rates on client financing\\n\\nactivities in Equities.\\n\\nOther income decreased $988 million primarily due to\\n\\ncertain valuation adjustments.\\n\\nProvision for Credit Losses\\n\\nThe provision for credit losses increased $7.1 billion to $2.5\\n\\nbillion for 2022 compared to 2021. The provision for credit\\n\\nlosses for 2022 was primarily driven by loan growth and a\\n\\ndampened macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reserve\\n\\nrelease for reduced COVID-19 pandemic (the pandemic)\\n\\nuncertainties. For the same period in the prior year, the benefit\\n\\nin the provision for credit losses was due to an improved\\n\\nmacroeconomic outlook.

We believe that cash\\n\\nflows from operations, available cash balances and our ability to\\n\\ngenerate cash through short- and long-term debt are sufficient to\\n\\nfund our operating liquidity needs. Our investing activities\\n\\nprimarily include the debt securities portfolio and loans and\\n\\nleases. Our financing activities reflect cash flows primarily\\n\\nrelated to customer deposits, securities financing agreements,\\n\\nlong-term debt and common and preferred stock. For more\\n\\ninformation on liquidity, see Liquidity Risk on page 101.\\n\\nSupplemental Financial Data\\n\\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\\n\\nIn this Form 10-K, we present certain non-GAAP financial\\n\\nmeasures. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items\\n\\nor otherwise include components that differ from the most\\n\\ndirectly comparable measures calculated in accordance with\\n\\nGAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional\\n\\nuseful information to assess our financial condition, results of\\n\\noperations (including period-to-period operating performance) or\\n\\ncompliance with prospective regulatory requirements. These\\n\\nnon-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute\\n\\nfor GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or\\n\\ncalculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used\\n\\nby other companies.\\n\\nWe view net interest income and related ratios and analyses\\n\\non an FTE basis, which when presented on a consolidated basis\\n\\nare non-GAAP financial measures. To derive the FTE basis, net\\n\\ninterest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an\\n\\nequivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in\\n\\nincome tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use\\n\\nthe federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent and a representative\\n\\nstate tax rate. Net interest yield, which measures the basis\\n\\npoints we earn over the cost of funds, utilizes net interest\\n\\nincome on an FTE basis. We believe that presentation of these\\n\\nitems on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from\\n\\nboth taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with\\n\\nindustry practices.\\n\\nWe may present certain key performance indicators and\\n\\nratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment\\n\\n(DVA) gains (losses)), which result in non-GAAP financial\\n\\nmeasures. We believe that the presentation of measures that\\n\\nexclude these items is useful because such measures provide\\n\\nadditional information to assess the underlying operational\\n\\nperformance and trends of our businesses and to allow better\\n\\ncomparison of period-to-period operating performance.\\n\\nWe also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that\\n\\nutilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible\\n\\nequity\\n\\nrepresents\\n\\nshareholders’\\n\\nequity\\n\\nor\\n\\ncommon\\n\\nshareholders’ equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets\\n\\n(excluding mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net of related\\n\\ndeferred tax liabilities (“adjusted” shareholders’ equity or\\n\\ncommon shareholders’ equity). These measures are used to\\n\\nevaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship\\n\\nand investment models use both return on average tangible\\n\\ncommon shareholders’ equity and return on average tangible\\n\\nshareholders’ equity as key measures to support our overall\\n\\ngrowth objectives. These ratios are:\\n\\n\\n\\nReturn on average tangible common shareholders’ equity\\n\\nmeasures our net income applicable to common\\n\\nshareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common\\n\\nshareholders’ equity. The tangible common equity ratio\\n\\nrepresents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity\\n\\ndivided by total tangible assets.\\n\\n\\n\\nReturn on average tangible shareholders’ equity measures\\n\\nour net income as a percentage of adjusted average total\\n\\nshareholders’ equity. The tangible equity ratio represents\\n\\nadjusted ending shareholders’ equity divided by total\\n\\ntangible assets.\\n\\n\\n\\nTangible book value per common share represents adjusted\\n\\nending common shareholders’ equity divided by ending\\n\\ncommon shares outstanding.\\n\\nWe believe ratios utilizing tangible equity provide additional\\n\\nuseful information because they present measures of those\\n\\nassets that can generate income. Tangible book value per\\n\\ncommon share provides additional useful information about the\\n\\nlevel of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of\\n\\ncommon stock.\\n\\nThe aforementioned supplemental data and performance\\n\\nmeasures are presented in Tables 6 and 7.\\n\\nFor more information on the reconciliation of these non-GAAP\\n\\nfinancial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial\\n\\nmeasures, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 132.\\n\\nKey Performance Indicators\\n\\nWe present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance\\n\\nindicators (key performance indicators) that management uses\\n\\nwhen assessing our consolidated and/or segment results. We\\n\\nbelieve they are useful to investors because they provide\\n\\nadditional information about our underlying operational\\n\\nperformance and trends. These key performance indicators\\n\\n(KPIs) may not be defined or calculated in the same way as\\n\\nsimilar KPIs used by other companies. For information on how\\n\\nthese metrics are defined, see Key Metrics on page 214.\\n\\nOur consolidated key performance indicators, which include\\n\\nvarious equity and credit metrics, are presented in Table 1 on\\n\\npage 75, Table 6 on page 80 and Table 7 on page 81.\\n\\nFor information on key segment performance metrics, see\\n\\nBusiness Segment Operations on page 84.\\n\\nBank of America 2022 79\\n\\nTable 6 Selected Annual Financial Data\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n(2)\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n(4)\\n\\n(5)\\n\\n2021\\n\\n2022\\n\\n(In millions, except per share information)\\n\\nIncome statement\\n\\nNet interest income\\n\\nNoninterest income\\n\\nTotal revenue, net of interest expense\\n\\nProvision for credit losses\\n\\nNoninterest expense\\n\\nIncome before income taxes\\n\\nIncome tax expense\\n\\nNet income\\n\\nNet income applicable to common shareholders\\n\\nAverage common shares issued and outstanding\\n\\nAverage diluted common shares issued and outstanding\\n\\nPerformance ratios\\n\\nReturn on average assets (1)\\n\\nReturn on average common shareholders’ equity (1)\\n\\nReturn on average tangible common shareholders’ equity (1, 2)\\n\\nReturn on average shareholders’ equity (1)\\n\\nReturn on average tangible shareholders’ equity (1, 2)\\n\\nTotal ending equity to total ending assets\\n\\nCommon equity ratio (1)\\n\\nTotal average equity to total average assets\\n\\nDividend payout (1)\\n\\nPer common share data\\n\\nEarnings\\n\\nDiluted earnings\\n\\nDividends paid\\n\\nBook value (1)\\n\\nTangible book value (2)\\n\\nMarket capitalization\\n\\nAverage balance sheet\\n\\nTotal loans and leases\\n\\nTotal assets\\n\\nTotal deposits\\n\\nLong-term debt\\n\\nCommon shareholders’ equity\\n\\nTotal shareholders’ equity\\n\\nAsset quality\\n\\nAllowance for credit losses (3)\\n\\nNonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties (4)\\n\\nAllowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding (4)\\n\\nAllowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total nonperforming loans and leases (4)\\n\\nNet charge-offs\\n\\nNet charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases outstanding (4)\\n\\nCapital ratios at year end (5)\\n\\nCommon equity tier 1 capital\\n\\nTier 1 capital\\n\\nTotal capital\\n\\nTier 1 leverage\\n\\nSupplementary leverage ratio\\n\\nTangible equity (2)\\n\\nTangible common equity (2)\\n\\n$\\n\\n52,462\\n\\n42,488\\n\\n94,950\\n\\n2,543\\n\\n61,438\\n\\n30,969\\n\\n3,441\\n\\n27,528\\n\\n26,015\\n\\n8,113.7\\n\\n8,167.5\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n3.21\\n\\n3.19\\n\\n0.86\\n\\n30.61\\n\\n21.83\\n\\n264,853\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n$ 1,016,782\\n\\n3,135,894\\n\\n1,986,158\\n\\n246,479\\n\\n241,981\\n\\n270,299\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n14,222\\n\\n3,978\\n\\n1.22 %\\n\\n333\\n\\n2,172\\n\\n0.21 %\\n\\n11.2 %\\n\\n13.0\\n\\n14.9\\n\\n7.0\\n\\n5.9\\n\\n6.8\\n\\n5.9\\n\\n$\\n\\n1.05 %\\n\\n12.23\\n\\n17.02\\n\\n11.68\\n\\n15.71\\n\\n8.52\\n\\n7.74\\n\\n9.02\\n\\n21.51\\n\\n0.88 %\\n\\n10.75\\n\\n15.15\\n\\n10.18\\n\\n13.76\\n\\n8.95\\n\\n8.02\\n\\n8.62\\n\\n26.77\\n\\n$\\n\\n42,934\\n\\n46,179\\n\\n89,113\\n\\n(4,594)\\n\\n59,731\\n\\n33,976\\n\\n1,998\\n\\n31,978\\n\\n30,557\\n\\n8,493.3\\n\\n8,558.4\\n\\n2020\\n\\n$\\n\\n3.60\\n\\n3.57\\n\\n0.78\\n\\n30.37\\n\\n21.68\\n\\n359,383\\n\\n920,401\\n\\n3,034,623\\n\\n1,914,286\\n\\n237,703\\n\\n249,787\\n\\n273,757\\n\\n13,843\\n\\n4,697\\n\\n1.28 %\\n\\n271\\n\\n2,243\\n\\n0.25 %\\n\\n10.6 %\\n\\n12.1\\n\\n14.1\\n\\n6.4\\n\\n5.5\\n\\n6.4\\n\\n5.7\\n\\n43,360\\n\\n42,168\\n\\n85,528\\n\\n11,320\\n\\n55,213\\n\\n18,995\\n\\n1,101\\n\\n17,894\\n\\n16,473\\n\\n8,753.2\\n\\n8,796.9\\n\\n0.67 %\\n\\n6.76\\n\\n9.48\\n\\n6.69\\n\\n9.07\\n\\n9.68\\n\\n8.81\\n\\n9.96\\n\\n38.18\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n1.88\\n\\n1.87\\n\\n0.72\\n\\n28.72\\n\\n20.60\\n\\n262,206\\n\\n982,467\\n\\n2,683,122\\n\\n1,632,998\\n\\n220,440\\n\\n243,685\\n\\n267,309\\n\\n20,680\\n\\n5,116\\n\\n2.04 %\\n\\n380\\n\\n4,121\\n\\n0.42 %\\n\\n11.9 %\\n\\n13.5\\n\\n16.1\\n\\n7.4\\n\\n7.2\\n\\n7.4\\n\\n6.5\\n\\nFor definition, see Key Metrics on page 214.\\n\\nTangible equity ratios and tangible book value per share of common stock are non-GAAP financial measures.

We manage our segments and report their results on an FTE\\n\\nbasis. The primary activities, products and businesses of the business segments and All Other are shown below.\\n\\nWe periodically review capital allocated to our businesses\\n\\nand allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital\\n\\nplanning processes. We utilize a methodology that considers\\n\\nthe effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to\\n\\ninternal risk-based capital models. Our internal risk-based\\n\\ncapital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating\\n\\neach segment’s credit, market, interest rate, business and\\n\\noperational risk components. For more information on the\\n\\nnature of these risks, see Managing Risk on page 93. The\\n\\ncapital allocated to the business segments is referred to as\\n\\nallocated capital. Allocated equity in the reporting units is\\n\\ncomprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of\\n\\ngoodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting\\n\\nunit. For more information, including the definition of a reporting\\n\\nunit, see Note 7 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the\\n\\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\\n\\n84 Bank of America 2022\\n\\nFor more information on our presentation of financial\\n\\ninformation on an FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data\\n\\non page 79, and for reconciliations to consolidated total\\n\\nrevenue, net income and year-end total assets, see Note 23 –\\n\\nBusiness Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial\\n\\nStatements.\\n\\nKey Performance Indicators\\n\\nWe present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance\\n\\nindicators that management uses when evaluating segment\\n\\nresults.

Both periods included income\\n\\ntax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of\\n\\ncertain tax credits recorded in Global Banking and Global\\n\\nMarkets.\\n\\nManaging Risk\\n\\nRisk is inherent in all our business activities. Sound risk\\n\\nmanagement enables us to serve our customers and deliver for\\n\\nour shareholders. If not managed well, risk can result in\\n\\nfinancial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage\\n\\nto our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability\\n\\nto execute our business strategies. We take a comprehensive\\n\\napproach to risk management with a defined Risk Framework\\n\\nand an articulated Risk Appetite Statement, which are approved\\n\\nannually by the ERC and the Board.\\n\\nThe seven key types of risk faced by the Corporation are\\n\\nstrategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and\\n\\nreputational.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStrategic risk is the risk to current or projected financial\\n\\ncondition arising from incorrect assumptions about external\\n\\nor internal factors, inappropriate business plans, ineffective\\n\\nbusiness strategy execution or failure to respond in a timely\\n\\nmanner to changes in the regulatory, macroeconomic or\\n\\ncompetitive environments in the geographic locations in\\n\\nwhich we operate.\\n\\nCredit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or\\n\\nfailure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations.\\n\\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market conditions\\n\\nadversely impact the value of assets or liabilities or\\n\\notherwise negatively impact earnings. Market risk is\\n\\ncomposed of price risk and interest rate risk.\\n\\nLiquidity risk is the inability to meet expected or unexpected\\n\\ncash flow and collateral needs while continuing to support\\n\\nour businesses and customers under a range of economic\\n\\nconditions.\\n\\nCompliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions,\\n\\nmaterial financial loss or damage to the reputation of the\\n\\nCorporation arising from the failure of the Corporation to\\n\\ncomply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules and\\n\\nregulations and our internal policies and procedures.\\n\\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate\\n\\nor failed internal processes or systems, people or external\\n\\nevents.\\n\\nReputational risk is the risk that negative perception of the\\n\\nCorporation may adversely impact profitability or operations.\\n\\nThe following sections address in more detail the specific\\n\\nprocedures, measures and analyses of the major categories of\\n\\nrisk. This discussion of managing risk focuses on the current\\n\\nRisk Framework that, as part of its annual review process, was\\n\\napproved by the ERC and the Board.\\n\\nAs set forth in our Risk Framework, a culture of managing\\n\\nrisk well is fundamental to our values and our purpose, and how\\n\\nwe drive Responsible Growth. It requires us to focus on risk in\\n\\nall activities and encourages the necessary mindset and\\n\\nbehavior to enable effective risk management and promote\\n\\nsound risk-taking within our risk appetite. Sustaining a culture of\\n\\nmanaging risk well throughout the organization is critical to the\\n\\nsuccess of the Corporation and is a clear expectation of our\\n\\nexecutive management team and the Board.\\n\\nOur Risk Framework serves as the foundation for the\\n\\nconsistent and effective management of risks facing the\\n\\nCorporation. The Risk Framework sets forth roles and\\n\\nresponsibilities for the management of risk and provides a\\n\\nblueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to\\n\\ncommittees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite\\n\\nand associated limits for our activities.\\n\\nExecutive management assesses, with Board oversight, the\\n\\nrisk-adjusted returns of each business. Management reviews\\n\\nand approves the strategic and financial operating plans, as well\\n\\nas the capital plan and Risk Appetite Statement, and\\n\\nrecommends them annually to the Board for approval. Our\\n\\nstrategic plan takes into consideration return objectives and\\n\\nfinancial resources, which must align with risk capacity and risk\\n\\nappetite. Management sets financial objectives for each\\n\\nbusiness by allocating capital and setting a target for return on\\n\\ncapital for each business. Capital allocations and operating\\n\\nlimits are regularly evaluated as part of our overall governance\\n\\nprocesses as the businesses and the economic environment in\\n\\nwhich we operate continue to evolve. For more information\\n\\nregarding capital allocations, see Business Segment Operations\\n\\non page 84.\\n\\nThe Corporation’s risk appetite indicates the amount of\\n\\ncapital, earnings or liquidity we are willing to put at risk to\\n\\nachieve our strategic objectives and business plans, consistent\\n\\nwith applicable regulatory requirements. Our risk appetite\\n\\nprovides a common framework that includes a set of measures\\n\\nto assist senior management and the Board in assessing the\\n\\nCorporation’s risk profile against our risk appetite and risk\\n\\ncapacity. Our risk appetite is formally articulated in the Risk\\n\\nAppetite Statement, which includes both qualitative statements\\n\\nand quantitative limits.\\n\\nOur overall capacity to take risk is limited; therefore, we\\n\\nprioritize the risks we take in order to maintain a strong and\\n\\nflexible financial position so we can withstand challenging\\n\\neconomic conditions and take advantage of organic growth\\n\\nopportunities. Therefore, we set objectives and targets for\\n\\ncapital and liquidity that are intended to permit us to continue to\\n\\noperate in a safe and sound manner at all times, including\\n\\nduring periods of stress.\\n\\nOur lines of business operate with risk limits that align with\\n\\nthe Corporation’s risk appetite. Senior management is\\n\\nresponsible\\n\\nfor\\n\\ntracking\\n\\nand\\n\\nreporting\\n\\nperformance\\n\\nmeasurements as well as any exceptions to risk appetite limits.\\n\\nThe Board, and its committees when appropriate, oversee\\n\\nfinancial performance, execution of the strategic and financial\\n\\noperating plans, adherence to risk appetite limits and the\\n\\nadequacy of internal controls.\\n\\nFor a more detailed discussion of our risk management\\n\\nactivities, see the discussion below and pages 96 through 129.\\n\\nRisk Management Governance\\n\\nThe Risk Framework describes delegations of authority whereby\\n\\nthe Board and its committees may delegate authority to\\n\\nmanagement-level committees or executive officers. Such\\n\\ndelegations may authorize certain decision-making and approval\\n\\nfunctions, which may be evidenced in documents such as\\n\\ncommittee charters, job descriptions, meeting minutes and\\n\\nresolutions.\\n\\nThe chart below illustrates the interrelationship among the\\n\\nBoard, Board committees and management committees that\\n\\nhave the majority of risk oversight responsibilities for the\\n\\nCorporation.\\n\\nBank of America 2022 93\\n\\nBoa rd of Dire ctors\\n\\nI\\n\\nCorpo rate\\n\\n- - -\\n\\nBoard\\n\\nCommittees\\n\\nI\\n\\nI\\n\\nI\\n\\nAudit Committee\\n\\nEnterprise Risk\\n\\nCommittee\\n\\nGovernance.

The Board authorizes management to maintain\\n\\nan effective Risk Framework and oversees compliance with safe\\n\\nand sound banking practices. In addition, the Board or its\\n\\ncommittees conduct inquiries of, and receive reports from\\n\\nsenior management on, risk-related matters to assess scope or\\n\\nresource limitations that could impede the ability of Global Risk\\n\\nManagement (GRM) and/or Corporate Audit to execute its\\n\\nresponsibilities. The Board committees discussed below have\\n\\nthe principal responsibility for enterprise-wide oversight of our\\n\\nrisk management activities. Through these activities, the Board\\n\\nand applicable committees are provided with information on our\\n\\nrisk profile and oversee senior management addressing key\\n\\nrisks we face. Other Board committees, as described below,\\n\\nprovide additional oversight of specific risks.\\n\\nEach of the committees shown on the above chart regularly\\n\\nreports to the Board on risk-related matters within the\\n\\ncommittee’s responsibilities, which is intended to collectively\\n\\nprovide the Board with integrated insight about our management\\n\\nof enterprise-wide risks.\\n\\nAudit Committee\\n\\nThe Audit Committee oversees the qualifications, performance\\n\\nand independence of the Independent Registered Public\\n\\nAccounting Firm, the performance of our corporate audit\\n\\nfunction, the integrity of our consolidated financial statements,\\n\\nour compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and\\n\\nmakes inquiries of senior management or the Chief Audit\\n\\nExecutive (CAE) to determine whether there are scope or\\n\\nresource limitations that impede the ability of Corporate Audit to\\n\\nexecute its responsibilities. The Audit Committee is also\\n\\nresponsible for overseeing compliance risks pursuant to the\\n\\nNew York Stock Exchange listing standards.\\n\\nEnterprise Risk Committee\\n\\nThe ERC oversees the Corporation’s Risk Framework, risk\\n\\nappetite and senior management’s responsibilities for the\\n\\nidentification, measurement, monitoring and control of key risks\\n\\nfacing the Corporation. The ERC may consult with other Board\\n\\ncommittees on risk-related matters.\\n\\nOther Board Committees\\n\\nOur Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee\\n\\noversees our Board’s governance processes, identifies and\\n\\nreviews the qualifications of potential Board members, leads\\n\\n94 Bank of America 2022\\n\\nBoard and committee succession planning and their formal selfevaluation, and reviews our ESG activities, shareholder input\\n\\nand shareholder engagement process.\\n\\nOur Compensation and Human Capital Committee oversees\\n\\nestablishing, maintaining and administering our compensation\\n\\nprograms and employee benefit plans, including approving and\\n\\nrecommending our Chief Executive Officer’s (CEO) compensation\\n\\nto our Board for further approval by all independent directors;\\n\\nreviewing and approving our executive officers’ compensation,\\n\\nas well as compensation for non-management directors; and\\n\\nreviewing certain other human capital management topics,\\n\\nincluding pay equity and diversity and inclusion.\\n\\nManagement Committees\\n\\nManagement committees receive their authority from the Board,\\n\\na Board committee, or another management committee. Our\\n\\nprimary management risk committee is the MRC. Subject to\\n\\nBoard oversight, the MRC is responsible for management\\n\\noversight of key risks facing the Corporation, including an\\n\\nintegrated evaluation of risk, earnings, capital and liquidity.\\n\\nLines of Defense\\n\\nWe have clear ownership and accountability for managing risk\\n\\nacross three lines of defense: Front Line Units (FLUs), GRM and\\n\\nCorporate Audit. We also have control functions outside of FLUs\\n\\nand GRM (e.g., Legal and Global Human Resources). The three\\n\\nlines of defense are integrated into our management-level\\n\\ngovernance structure. Each of these functional roles is further\\n\\ndescribed in this section.\\n\\nExecutive Officers\\n\\nExecutive officers lead various functions representing the\\n\\nfunctional roles. Authority for functional roles may be delegated\\n\\nto executive officers from the Board, Board committees or\\n\\nmanagement-level committees. Executive officers, in turn, may\\n\\nfurther delegate responsibilities, as appropriate, to\\n\\nmanagement-level committees, management routines or\\n\\nindividuals. Executive officers review our activities for\\n\\nconsistency with our Risk Framework, risk appetite, and\\n\\napplicable strategic, capital and financial operating plans, as\\n\\nwell as applicable policies and standards. Executive officers and\\n\\nother employees make decisions individually on a day-to-day\\n\\nbasis, consistent with the authority they have been delegated.\\n\\nExecutive officers and other employees may also serve on\\n\\ncommittees and participate in committee decisions.\\n\\nFront Line Units\\n\\nFLUs, which include the lines of business as well as Global\\n\\nTechnology and Global Operations, are responsible for\\n\\nappropriately assessing and effectively managing all of the risks\\n\\nassociated with their activities.\\n\\nThree organizational units that include FLU activities and\\n\\ncontrol function activities, but are not part of GRM are first, the\\n\\nChief Financial Officer Group; second, the Chief Administrative\\n\\nOfficer Group; and third, Global Strategy and Enterprise\\n\\nPlatforms.\\n\\nGlobal Risk Management\\n\\nGRM is part of our control functions and operates as our\\n\\nindependent risk management function. GRM, led by the Chief\\n\\nRisk Officer (CRO), is responsible for independently assessing\\n\\nand overseeing risks within FLUs and other control functions.\\n\\nGRM establishes written enterprise policies and procedures\\n\\noutlining how aggregate risks are identified, measured,\\n\\nmonitored and controlled.\\n\\nThe CRO has the stature, authority and independence needed\\n\\nto develop and implement a meaningful risk management\\n\\nframework and practices to guide the Corporation in managing\\n\\nrisk. The CRO has unrestricted access to the Board and reports\\n\\ndirectly to both the ERC and the CEO. GRM is organized into\\n\\nhorizontal risk teams that cover a specific risk area and vertical\\n\\nCRO teams that cover a particular FLU or control function. These\\n\\nteams work collaboratively in executing their respective duties.\\n\\nCorporate Audit\\n\\nCorporate Audit and the CAE maintain their independence from\\n\\nthe FLUs, GRM and other control functions by reporting directly\\n\\nto the Audit Committee. The CAE administratively reports to the\\n\\nCEO. Corporate Audit provides independent assessment and\\n\\nvalidation through testing of key processes and controls across\\n\\nthe Corporation. Corporate Audit includes Credit Review, which\\n\\nprovides an independent assessment of credit lending decisions\\n\\nand the effectiveness of credit processes across the\\n\\nCorporation’s credit platform through examinations and\\n\\nmonitoring.\\n\\nRisk Management Processes\\n\\nThe Risk Framework requires that strong risk management\\n\\npractices are integrated in key strategic, capital and financial\\n\\nplanning processes and in day-to-day business processes\\n\\nacross the Corporation, thereby ensuring risks are appropriately\\n\\nconsidered, evaluated and responded to in a timely manner. We\\n\\nemploy an effective risk management process, referred to as\\n\\nIdentify, Measure, Monitor and Control, as part of our daily\\n\\nactivities.\\n\\nIdentify – To be effectively managed, risks must be proactively\\n\\nidentified and well understood. Proper risk identification\\n\\nfocuses on recognizing and understanding key risks inherent\\n\\nin our business activities or key risks that may arise from\\n\\nexternal factors. Each employee is expected to identify and\\n\\nescalate risks promptly. Risk identification is an ongoing\\n\\nprocess that incorporates input from FLUs and control\\n\\nfunctions. It is designed to be forward-looking and to capture\\n\\nrelevant risk factors across all of our lines of business.\\n\\nMeasure – Once a risk is identified, it must be prioritized and\\n\\naccurately measured through a systematic process including\\n\\nqualitative statements and quantitative limits. Risk is\\n\\nmeasured at various levels, including, but not limited to, risk\\n\\ntype, FLU and legal entity, and also on an aggregate basis.\\n\\nThis risk measurement process helps to capture changes in\\n\\nour risk profile due to changes in strategic direction,\\n\\nconcentrations, portfolio quality and the overall economic\\n\\nenvironment. Senior management considers how risk\\n\\nexposures might evolve under a variety of stress scenarios.\\n\\nMonitor – We monitor risk levels regularly to track adherence to\\n\\nrisk appetite, policies and standards. We also regularly\\n\\nupdate risk assessments and review risk exposures. Through\\n\\nour monitoring, we know our level of risk relative to limits and\\n\\ncan take action in a timely manner. We also know when risk\\n\\nlimits are breached and have processes to appropriately\\n\\nreport and escalate exceptions. This includes timely requests\\n\\nfor approval to managers and alerts to executive\\n\\nmanagement, management-level committees or the Board\\n\\n(directly or through an appropriate committee).\\n\\nControl – We establish and communicate risk limits and controls\\n\\nthrough policies, standards, procedures and processes. The\\n\\nlimits and controls can be adjusted by senior management or\\n\\nthe Board when conditions or risk tolerances warrant. These\\n\\nlimits may be absolute (e.g., loan amount, trading volume,\\n\\noperational loss) or relative (e.g., percentage of loan book in\\n\\nhigher-risk categories). Our FLUs are held accountable for\\n\\nperforming within the established limits.\\n\\nThe formal processes used to manage risk represent a part\\n\\nof our overall risk management process. We instill a strong and\\n\\ncomprehensive culture of managing risk well through\\n\\ncommunications,\\n\\ntraining,\\n\\npolicies,\\n\\nprocedures\\n\\nand\\n\\norganizational roles and responsibilities. Establishing a culture\\n\\nreflective of our purpose to help make our customers’ financial\\n\\nlives better and delivering on Responsible Growth is also critical\\n\\nto effective risk management. We are committed to the highest\\n\\nprinciples of ethical and professional conduct. Conduct risk is\\n\\nthe risk of improper actions, behaviors or practices by the\\n\\nCorporation, its employees or representatives that are illegal,\\n\\nunethical and/or contrary to our core values that could result in\\n\\nharm to the Corporation, our shareholders or our customers,\\n\\ndamage the integrity of the financial markets, or negatively\\n\\nimpact our reputation. We have established protocols and\\n\\nstructures so that conduct risk is governed and reported across\\n\\nthe Corporation appropriately. All employees are held\\n\\naccountable for adhering to the Code of Conduct, operating\\n\\nwithin our risk appetite and managing risk in their daily business\\n\\nactivities. In addition, our performance management and\\n\\ncompensation practices encourage responsible risk-taking that\\n\\nis consistent with our Risk Framework and risk appetite.\\n\\nCorporation-wide Stress Testing\\n\\nIntegral to our Capital Planning, Financial Planning and Strategic\\n\\nPlanning processes, we conduct capital scenario management\\n\\nand stress forecasting on a periodic basis to better understand\\n\\nbalance sheet, earnings and capital sensitivities to certain\\n\\neconomic and business scenarios, including economic and\\n\\nmarket conditions that are more severe than anticipated. These\\n\\nstress forecasts provide an understanding of the potential\\n\\nimpacts from our risk profile on the balance sheet, earnings and\\n\\ncapital, and serve as a key component of our capital and risk\\n\\nmanagement practices. The intent of stress testing is to\\n\\ndevelop a comprehensive understanding of potential impacts of\\n\\non- and off-balance sheet risks at the Corporation and certain\\n\\nsubsidiaries and how they impact financial resiliency, which\\n\\nprovides confidence to management, regulators and our\\n\\ninvestors.\\n\\nContingency Planning\\n\\nWe have developed and maintain contingency plans that are\\n\\ndesigned to prepare us in advance to respond in the event of\\n\\nBank of America 2022 95\\n\\npotential adverse economic, financial or market stress. These\\n\\ncontingency plans include our Capital Contingency Plan and\\n\\nFinancial Contingency and Recovery Plan, which provide\\n\\nmonitoring, escalation, actions and routines designed to enable\\n\\nus to increase capital, access funding sources and reduce risk\\n\\nthrough consideration of potential options that include asset\\n\\nsales, business sales, capital or debt issuances, and other derisking strategies. We also maintain a Resolution Plan to limit\\n\\nadverse systemic impacts that could be associated with a\\n\\npotential resolution of Bank of America.\\n\\nStrategic Risk Management\\n\\nStrategic risk is embedded in every business and is one of the\\n\\nmajor risk categories along with credit, market, liquidity,\\n\\ncompliance, operational and reputational risks. This risk results\\n\\nfrom incorrect assumptions about external or internal factors,\\n\\ninappropriate business plans, ineffective business strategy\\n\\nexecution, or failure to respond in a timely manner to changes in\\n\\nthe regulatory, macroeconomic or competitive environments in\\n\\nthe geographic locations in which we operate, such as\\n\\ncompetitor actions, changing customer preferences, product\\n\\nobsolescence and technology developments.\\n\\nAn aspect of strategic risk is the risk that the Corporation’s\\n\\ncapital levels are not adequate to meet minimum regulatory\\n\\nrequirements and support execution of business activities or\\n\\nabsorb losses from risks during normal or adverse economic\\n\\nand market conditions. As such, capital risk is managed in\\n\\nparallel to strategic risk.\\n\\nWe manage strategic risk through the Strategic Risk\\n\\nEnterprise Policy and integration into the strategic planning\\n\\nprocess, among other activities. Our strategic plan is consistent\\n\\nwith our risk appetite, capital plan and liquidity requirements,\\n\\nand specifically addresses strategic risks impacting each\\n\\nbusiness.\\n\\nOn an annual basis, the Board reviews and approves the\\n\\nstrategic plan, capital plan, financial operating plan and Risk\\n\\nAppetite Statement. With oversight by the Board, senior\\n\\nmanagement directs the lines of business to execute our\\n\\nstrategic plan consistent with our core operating principles and\\n\\nrisk appetite. The executive management team monitors\\n\\nbusiness performance throughout the year and provides the\\n\\nBoard with regular progress reports on whether strategic\\n\\nobjectives and timelines are being met, including reports on\\n\\nstrategic risks and if additional or alternative actions need to be\\n\\nconsidered or implemented. The regular executive reviews focus\\n\\non assessing forecasted earnings and returns on capital, the\\n\\ncurrent risk profile, current capital and liquidity requirements,\\n\\nstaffing levels and changes required to support the strategic\\n\\nplan, stress testing results, and other qualitative factors such\\n\\nas market growth rates and peer analysis.\\n\\nSignificant strategic actions, such as capital actions,\\n\\nmaterial acquisitions or divestitures, and resolution plans are\\n\\nreviewed and approved by the Board. At the business level,\\n\\nprocesses are in place to discuss the strategic risk implications\\n\\nof new, expanded or modified businesses, products or services\\n\\nand other strategic initiatives, and to provide formal review and\\n\\napproval where required. With oversight by the Board and the\\n\\nERC, executive management performs similar analyses\\n\\nthroughout the year, and evaluates changes to the financial\\n\\nforecast or the risk, capital or liquidity positions as deemed\\n\\nappropriate to balance and optimize achieving the targeted risk\\n\\nappetite, shareholder returns and maintaining the targeted\\n\\nfinancial strength. Proprietary models are used to measure the\\n\\ncapital requirements for credit, country, market, operational and\\n\\nstrategic risks. The allocated capital assigned to each business\\n\\n96 Bank of America 2022\\n\\nis based on its unique risk profile. With oversight by the Board,\\n\\nexecutive management assesses the risk-adjusted returns of\\n\\neach business in approving strategic and financial operating\\n\\nplans. The businesses use allocated capital to define business\\n\\nstrategies, and price products and transactions.\\n\\nCapital Management\\n\\nThe Corporation manages its capital position so that its capital\\n\\nis more than adequate to support its business activities and\\n\\naligns with risk, risk appetite and strategic planning.\\n\\nAdditionally, we seek to maintain safety and soundness at all\\n\\ntimes, even under adverse scenarios, take advantage of organic\\n\\ngrowth opportunities, meet obligations to creditors and\\n\\ncounterparties, maintain ready access to financial markets,\\n\\ncontinue to serve as a credit intermediary, remain a source of\\n\\nstrength for our subsidiaries, and satisfy current and future\\n\\nregulatory capital requirements. Capital management is\\n\\nintegrated into our risk and governance processes, as capital is\\n\\na key consideration in the development of our strategic plan,\\n\\nrisk appetite and risk limits.\\n\\nWe conduct an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment\\n\\nProcess (ICAAP) on a periodic basis. The ICAAP is a forwardlooking assessment of our projected capital needs and\\n\\nresources, incorporating earnings, balance sheet and risk\\n\\nforecasts under baseline and adverse economic and market\\n\\nconditions. We utilize periodic stress tests to assess the\\n\\npotential impacts to our balance sheet, earnings, regulatory\\n\\ncapital and liquidity under a variety of stress scenarios. We\\n\\nperform qualitative risk assessments to identify and assess\\n\\nmaterial risks not fully captured in our forecasts or stress tests.\\n\\nWe assess the potential capital impacts of proposed changes to\\n\\nregulatory capital requirements. Management assesses ICAAP\\n\\nresults and provides documented quarterly assessments of the\\n\\nadequacy of our capital guidelines and capital position to the\\n\\nBoard or its committees.\\n\\nWe periodically review capital allocated to our businesses\\n\\nand allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital\\n\\nplanning processes. For more information, see Business\\n\\nSegment Operations on page 84.\\n\\nCCAR and Capital Planning\\n\\nThe Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and\\n\\nplanned capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the\\n\\nrules governing the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review\\n\\n(CCAR) capital plan. Based on the results of our 2022 CCAR\\n\\nstress test, our stress capital buffer (SCB) increased to 3.4\\n\\npercent from 2.5 percent, effective October 1, 2022 through\\n\\nSeptember 30, 2023.\\n\\nIn October 2021, the Board authorized the Corporation’s\\n\\n$25 billion common stock repurchase program. Additionally, the\\n\\nBoard authorized common stock repurchases to offset shares\\n\\nawarded under the Corporation’s equity-based compensation\\n\\nplans. Pursuant to the Board’s authorizations, during 2022, we\\n\\nrepurchased $5.1 billion of common stock, including\\n\\nrepurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based\\n\\ncompensation plans.\\n\\nThe timing and amount of common stock repurchases are\\n\\nsubject to various factors, including the Corporation’s capital\\n\\nposition, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of\\n\\ncapital, stock trading price, regulatory requirements and general\\n\\nmarket conditions, and may be suspended at any time. Such\\n\\nrepurchases may be effected through open market purchases or\\n\\nprivately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans\\n\\nthat satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities\\n\\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act).\\n\\nRegulatory Capital\\n\\nAs a financial services holding company, we are subject to\\n\\nregulatory capital rules, including Basel 3, issued by U.S.\\n\\nbanking regulators. Basel 3 established minimum capital ratios\\n\\nand buffer requirements and outlined two methods of\\n\\ncalculating risk-weighted assets (RWA), the Standardized\\n\\napproach and the Advanced approaches. The Standardized\\n\\napproach relies primarily on supervisory risk weights based on\\n\\nexposure type, and the Advanced approaches determine risk\\n\\nweights based on internal models.\\n\\nThe Corporation\\'s depository institution subsidiaries are also\\n\\nsubject to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. The\\n\\nCorporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are\\n\\nAdvanced approaches institutions under Basel 3 and are\\n\\nrequired to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and RWA\\n\\nunder both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The\\n\\nlower of the capital ratios under Standardized or Advanced\\n\\napproaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio\\n\\nrequirements are used to assess capital adequacy, including\\n\\nunder the PCA framework. As of December 31, 2022, the\\n\\ncommon equity tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1 capital and Total capital\\n\\nratios under the Standardized approach were the binding ratios.\\n\\nMinimum Capital Requirements\\n\\nIn order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and\\n\\ndiscretionary bonus payments, the Corporation must meet riskbased capital ratio requirements that include a capital\\n\\nconservation buffer of 2.5 percent (under the Advanced\\n\\napproaches only), an SCB (under the Standardized approach\\n\\nonly), plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a\\n\\nglobal systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge. The\\n\\nbuffers and surcharge must be comprised solely of CET1\\n\\ncapital. For the period from October 1, 2021 through September\\n\\n30, 2022, the Corporation\\'s minimum CET1 capital ratio\\n\\nrequirement was 9.5 percent under both the Standardized and\\n\\nAdvanced approaches. Based on the results of our 2022 CCAR\\n\\nstress test, the Corporation’s SCB increased to 3.4 percent,\\n\\nresulting in a minimum CET1 capital ratio requirement of 10.4\\n\\npercent under the Standardized approach for the period from\\n\\nOctober 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023. Our minimum\\n\\nCET1 capital ratio requirement under the Advanced approaches\\n\\nremains unchanged at 9.5 percent.\\n\\nThe Corporation is required to calculate its G-SIB surcharge\\n\\non an annual basis under two methods and is subject to the\\n\\nhigher of the resulting two surcharges. Method 1 is consistent\\n\\nwith the approach prescribed by the Basel Committee’s\\n\\nassessment methodology and is calculated using specified\\n\\nindicators of systemic importance. Method 2 modifies the\\n\\nMethod 1 approach by, among other factors, including a\\n\\nmeasure of the Corporation’s reliance on short-term wholesale\\n\\nfunding. The Corporation’s G-SIB surcharge, which is higher\\n\\nunder Method 2, is expected to increase to 3.0 percent from\\n\\n2.5 percent on January 1, 2024, which will increase our\\n\\nminimum CET1 capital ratio requirement. At December 31,\\n\\n2022, the Corporation’s CET1 capital ratio of 11.2 percent\\n\\nunder the Standardized approach exceeded its current CET1\\n\\ncapital ratio requirement as well as the minimum requirement\\n\\nexpected to be in place as of January 1, 2024 due to an\\n\\nanticipated increase in our G-SIB surcharge.\\n\\nThe Corporation is also required to maintain a minimum\\n\\nsupplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a\\n\\nleverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain\\n\\nrestrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus\\n\\npayments. Our insured depository institution subsidiaries are\\n\\nrequired to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be\\n\\nconsidered well capitalized under the PCA framework. The\\n\\nnumerator of the SLR is quarter-end Basel 3 Tier 1 capital. The\\n\\ndenominator is total leverage exposure based on the daily\\n\\naverage of the sum of on-balance sheet exposures less\\n\\npermitted deductions, and applicable temporary exclusions, as\\n\\nwell as the simple average of certain off-balance sheet\\n\\nexposures, as of the end of each month in a quarter.\\n\\nCapital Composition and Ratios\\n\\nTable 10 presents Bank of America Corporation’s capital ratios\\n\\nand related information in accordance with Basel 3\\n\\nStandardized and Advanced approaches as measured at\\n\\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021.

The long-term debt\\n\\nleverage exposure regulatory minimum is 4.5 percent.\\n\\nThe approach that yields the higher RWA is used to calculate TLAC and long-term debt ratios, which was the Standardized approach as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\\n\\nRegulatory Capital and Securities Regulation\\n\\nThe Corporation’s principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are\\n\\nBofA Securities, Inc. (BofAS), Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing\\n\\nCorp. (MLPCC) and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith\\n\\nIncorporated (MLPF&S). The Corporation\\'s principal European\\n\\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch International (MLI)\\n\\nand BofA Securities Europe SA (BofASE).\\n\\nThe U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the net\\n\\ncapital requirements of Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act.\\n\\nBofAS computes its minimum capital requirements as an\\n\\nalternative net capital broker-dealer under Rule 15c3-1e, and\\n\\nMLPCC and MLPF&S compute their minimum capital\\n\\nrequirements in accordance with the alternative standard under\\n\\nRule 15c3-1. BofAS and MLPCC are also registered as futures\\n\\ncommission merchants and are subject to Commodity Futures\\n\\nTrading Commission (CFTC) Regulation 1.17. The U.S. brokerdealer subsidiaries are also registered with the Financial\\n\\nIndustry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA). Pursuant to FINRA\\n\\nRule 4110, FINRA may impose higher net capital requirements\\n\\nthan Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act with respect to each\\n\\nof the broker-dealers.\\n\\nBofAS provides institutional services, and in accordance with\\n\\nthe alternative net capital requirements, is required to maintain\\n\\ntentative net capital in excess of $5.0 billion and net capital in\\n\\nexcess of the greater of $1.0 billion or a certain percentage of\\n\\nits reserve requirement in addition to a certain percentage of\\n\\nsecurities-based swap risk margin. BofAS must also notify the\\n\\nSEC in the event its tentative net capital is less than $6.0\\n\\nbillion. BofAS is also required to hold a certain percentage of its\\n\\ncustomers\\' and affiliates\\' risk-based margin in order to meet its\\n\\nCFTC minimum net capital requirement. At December 31, 2022,\\n\\nBofAS had tentative net capital of $20.9 billion. BofAS also had\\n\\nregulatory net capital of $17.5 billion, which exceeded the\\n\\nminimum requirement of $4.1 billion.\\n\\nMLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of BofAS and\\n\\nprovides clearing and settlement services as well as prime\\n\\nbrokerage and arranged financing services for institutional\\n\\nclients. At December 31, 2022, MLPCC’s regulatory net capital\\n\\nof $7.5 billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $1.4\\n\\nbillion.\\n\\nMLPF&S provides retail services. At December 31, 2022,\\n\\nMLPF&S\\' regulatory net capital was $6.0 billion, which exceeded\\n\\nthe minimum requirement of $137 million.\\n\\nOur European broker-dealers are subject to requirements\\n\\nfrom U.S. and non-U.S. regulators. MLI, a U.K. investment firm,\\n\\nis regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the\\n\\nFinancial Conduct Authority and is subject to certain regulatory\\n\\ncapital requirements. At December 31, 2022, MLI’s capital\\n\\nresources were $33.4 billion, which exceeded the minimum\\n\\nPillar 1 requirement of $11.6 billion.\\n\\nBofASE is an authorized credit institution with its head office\\n\\nlocated in France. Previously, BofASE had been authorized as an\\n\\ninvestment firm, but following the European Union’s adoption of\\n\\nthe harmonized Investment Firm Directive and Investment Firm\\n\\nRegulation prudential regime, it was required to apply for\\n\\nreauthorization as a credit institution. The application was\\n\\napproved in November 2022 and became effective on\\n\\nDecember 8, 2022. BofASE is authorized and regulated by the\\n\\nAutorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution and the Autorité\\n\\ndes Marchés Financiers, and supervised under the Single\\n\\nSupervisory Mechanism by the European Central Bank. At\\n\\nDecember 31, 2022, BofASE\\'s capital resources were $9.0\\n\\nbillion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of\\n\\n$3.0 billion.\\n\\nIn addition, MLI and BofASE became conditionally registered\\n\\nwith the SEC as security-based swap dealers in the fourth\\n\\nquarter of 2021, and maintained net liquid assets at\\n\\nDecember 31, 2022 that exceeded the applicable minimum\\n\\nrequirements under the Exchange Act.\\n\\nLiquidity Risk\\n\\nFunding and Liquidity Risk Management\\n\\nOur primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet\\n\\nexpected or unexpected cash flow and collateral requirements,\\n\\nincluding payments under long-term debt agreements,\\n\\ncommitments to extend credit and customer deposit\\n\\nwithdrawals, while continuing to support our businesses and\\n\\ncustomers under a range of economic conditions. To achieve\\n\\nthat objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under\\n\\nexpected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and access\\n\\nto diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base,\\n\\nand seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks. These\\n\\nliquidity risk management practices have allowed us to\\n\\neffectively manage the market fluctuation from the rising\\n\\ninterest rate environment, inflationary pressures and\\n\\nmacroeconomic environment.\\n\\nWe define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to\\n\\ncash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we\\n\\ncan use to meet our contractual and contingent financial\\n\\nobligations as they arise. We manage our liquidity position\\n\\nthrough line-of-business and ALM activities, as well as through\\n\\nour legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current\\n\\nBank of America 2022 101\\n\\n(including intraday) basis under both expected and stressed\\n\\nconditions. We believe that a centralized approach to funding\\n\\nand liquidity management enhances our ability to monitor\\n\\nliquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources,\\n\\nminimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to\\n\\nliquidity events.\\n\\nThe Board approves our liquidity risk policy and the Financial\\n\\nContingency and Recovery Plan. The ERC establishes our\\n\\nliquidity risk tolerance levels. The MRC is responsible for\\n\\noverseeing liquidity risks and directing management to maintain\\n\\nexposures within the established tolerance levels. The MRC\\n\\nreviews and monitors our liquidity position and stress testing\\n\\nresults, approves certain liquidity risk limits and reviews the\\n\\nimpact of strategic decisions on our liquidity. For more\\n\\ninformation, see Managing Risk on page 93. Under this\\n\\ngovernance framework, we developed certain funding and\\n\\nliquidity risk management practices which include: maintaining\\n\\nliquidity at Bank of America Corporation (Parent) and selected\\n\\nsubsidiaries, including our bank subsidiaries and other\\n\\nregulated entities; determining what amounts of liquidity are\\n\\nappropriate for these entities based on analysis of debt\\n\\nmaturities and other potential cash outflows, including those\\n\\nthat we may experience during stressed market conditions;\\n\\ndiversifying funding sources, considering our asset profile and\\n\\nlegal entity structure; and performing contingency planning.\\n\\nNB Holdings Corporation\\n\\nThe Parent, which is a separate and distinct legal entity from our\\n\\nbank and nonbank subsidiaries, has an intercompany\\n\\narrangement with our wholly-owned holding company subsidiary,\\n\\nNB Holdings Corporation (NB Holdings). We have transferred,\\n\\nand agreed to transfer, additional Parent assets not required to\\n\\nsatisfy anticipated near-term expenditures to NB Holdings. The\\n\\nParent is expected to continue to have access to the same flow\\n\\nof dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to\\n\\nservice its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as\\n\\nit would have had it not entered into these arrangements and\\n\\ntransferred any assets. These arrangements support our\\n\\npreferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which\\n\\nonly the Parent would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy\\n\\nCode.\\n\\nIn consideration for the transfer of assets, NB Holdings\\n\\nissued a subordinated note to the Parent in a principal amount\\n\\nequal to the value of the transferred assets. The aggregate\\n\\nprincipal amount of the note will increase by the amount of any\\n\\nfuture asset transfers. NB Holdings also provided the Parent\\n\\nwith a committed line of credit that allows the Parent to draw\\n\\nfunds necessary to service near-term cash needs. These\\n\\narrangements support our preferred single point of entry\\n\\nresolution strategy, under which only the Parent would be\\n\\nresolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. These arrangements\\n\\ninclude provisions to terminate the line of credit, forgive the\\n\\nsubordinated note and require the Parent to transfer its\\n\\nremaining financial assets to NB Holdings if our projected\\n\\nliquidity resources deteriorate so severely that resolution of the\\n\\nParent becomes imminent.\\n\\nGlobal Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets\\n\\nWe maintain liquidity available to the Corporation, including the\\n\\nParent and selected subsidiaries, in the form of cash and highquality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Our liquidity buffer,\\n\\nreferred to as Global Liquidity Sources (GLS), is comprised of\\n\\n102 Bank of America 2022\\n\\nassets that are readily available to the Parent and selected\\n\\nsubsidiaries, including holding company, bank and broker-dealer\\n\\nsubsidiaries, even during stressed market conditions. Our cash\\n\\nis primarily on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank and, to a\\n\\nlesser extent, central banks outside of the U.S. We limit the\\n\\ncomposition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities to\\n\\nU.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency\\n\\nMBS and other investment-grade securities, and a select group\\n\\nof non-U.S. government securities. We can obtain cash for these\\n\\nsecurities, even in stressed conditions, through repurchase\\n\\nagreements or outright sales. We hold our GLS in legal entities\\n\\nthat allow us to meet the liquidity requirements of our global\\n\\nbusinesses, and we consider the impact of potential regulatory,\\n\\ntax, legal and other restrictions that could limit the\\n\\ntransferability of funds among entities.\\n\\nTable 15 presents average GLS for the three months ended\\n\\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021.\\n\\nTable 15 Average Global Liquidity Sources\\n\\n(Dollars in billions)\\n\\nBank entities\\n\\nNonbank and other entities (1)\\n\\nTotal Average Global Liquidity Sources\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\nThree Months Ended\\n\\nDecember 31\\n\\n2021\\n\\n2022\\n\\n1,006\\n\\n694 $\\n\\n152\\n\\n174\\n\\n1,158\\n\\n868 $\\n\\nNonbank includes Parent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities.\\n\\nOur bank subsidiaries’ liquidity is primarily driven by deposit\\n\\nand lending activity, as well as securities valuation and net debt\\n\\nactivity. Bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental\\n\\nliquidity by pledging a range of unencumbered loans and\\n\\nsecurities to certain FHLBs and the Federal Reserve Discount\\n\\nWindow. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against\\n\\nthis pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was $348\\n\\nbillion and $322 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. We\\n\\nhave established operational procedures to enable us to borrow\\n\\nagainst these assets, including regularly monitoring our total\\n\\npool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is\\n\\ndefined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve\\n\\nand is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory\\n\\nrestrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can\\n\\ngenerally be used only to fund obligations within the bank\\n\\nsubsidiaries, and transfers to the Parent or nonbank\\n\\nsubsidiaries may be subject to prior regulatory approval.\\n\\nLiquidity is also held in nonbank entities, including the\\n\\nParent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities. The Parent\\n\\nand NB Holdings liquidity is typically in the form of cash\\n\\ndeposited at BANA, which is excluded from the liquidity at bank\\n\\nsubsidiaries, and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities.\\n\\nLiquidity held in other regulated entities, comprised primarily of\\n\\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries, is primarily available to meet the\\n\\nobligations of that entity, and transfers to the Parent or to any\\n\\nother subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due\\n\\nto regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. Our other\\n\\nregulated entities also hold unencumbered investment-grade\\n\\nsecurities and equities that we believe could be used to\\n\\ngenerate additional liquidity.\\n\\nTable 16 presents the composition of average GLS for the\\n\\nthree months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31,\\n\\n2021.\\n\\nTable 16 Average Global Liquidity Sources Composition\\n\\n(Dollars in billions)\\n\\nCash on deposit\\n\\n$\\n\\nU.S. Treasury securities\\n\\nU.S. agency securities, mortgage-backed\\n\\nsecurities, and other investment-grade securities\\n\\nNon-U.S. government securities\\n\\nTotal Average Global Liquidity Sources\\n\\n$\\n\\nThree Months Ended\\n\\nDecember 31\\n\\n2021\\n\\n2022\\n\\n259\\n\\n174 $\\n\\n278\\n\\n252\\n\\n427\\n\\n15\\n\\n868\\n\\n$\\n\\n606\\n\\n15\\n\\n1,158\\n\\nOur GLS are substantially the same in composition to what\\n\\nqualifies as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final\\n\\nU.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules. However, HQLA for\\n\\npurposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but\\n\\nat a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the\\n\\nexclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The\\n\\nLCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution’s\\n\\nunencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows\\n\\nthe institution could encounter over a 30-day period of\\n\\nsignificant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our\\n\\naverage consolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $605 billion\\n\\nand $617 billion for the three months ended December 31,\\n\\n2022 and 2021. For the same periods, the average\\n\\nconsolidated LCR was 120 percent and 115 percent. Our LCR\\n\\nfluctuates due to normal business flows from customer activity.\\n\\nLiquidity Stress Analysis\\n\\nWe utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining\\n\\nthe appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the Parent\\n\\nand our subsidiaries to meet contractual and contingent cash\\n\\noutflows under a range of scenarios. The scenarios we consider\\n\\nand utilize incorporate market-wide and Corporation-specific\\n\\nevents, including potential credit rating downgrades for the\\n\\nParent and our subsidiaries, and more severe events including\\n\\npotential resolution scenarios. The scenarios are based on our\\n\\nhistorical experience, experience of distressed and failed\\n\\nfinancial institutions, regulatory guidance, and both expected\\n\\nand unexpected future events.\\n\\nThe types of potential contractual and contingent cash\\n\\noutflows we consider in our scenarios may include, but are not\\n\\nlimited to, upcoming contractual maturities of unsecured debt\\n\\nand reductions in new debt issuances; diminished access to\\n\\nsecured financing markets; potential deposit withdrawals;\\n\\nincreased draws on loan commitments, liquidity facilities and\\n\\nletters of credit; additional collateral that counterparties could\\n\\ncall if our credit ratings were downgraded; collateral and margin\\n\\nrequirements arising from market value changes; and potential\\n\\nliquidity required to maintain businesses and finance customer\\n\\nactivities. Changes in certain market factors, including, but not\\n\\nlimited to, credit rating downgrades, could negatively impact\\n\\npotential contractual and contingent outflows and the related\\n\\nfinancial instruments, and in some cases these impacts could\\n\\nbe material to our financial results.\\n\\nWe consider all sources of funds that we could access\\n\\nduring each stress scenario and focus particularly on matching\\n\\navailable sources with corresponding liquidity requirements by\\n\\nlegal entity. We also use the stress modeling results to manage\\n\\nour asset and liability profile and establish limits and guidelines\\n\\non certain funding sources and businesses.\\n\\nNet Stable Funding Ratio\\n\\nThe Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is a liquidity requirement\\n\\nfor large banks to maintain a minimum level of stable funding\\n\\nover a one-year period. The requirement is intended to support\\n\\nthe ability of banks to lend to households and businesses in\\n\\nboth normal and adverse economic conditions and is\\n\\ncomplementary to the LCR, which focuses on short-term liquidity\\n\\nrisks. The U.S. NSFR applies to the Corporation on a\\n\\nconsolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions. At\\n\\nDecember 31, 2022, the Corporation and its insured depository\\n\\ninstitutions were in compliance with this requirement.\\n\\nDiversified Funding Sources\\n\\nWe fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and\\n\\nsecured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally\\n\\ncoordinated funding approach diversified across products,\\n\\nprograms, markets, currencies and investor groups.\\n\\nThe primary benefits of our centralized funding approach\\n\\ninclude greater control, reduced funding costs, wider name\\n\\nrecognition by investors and greater flexibility to meet the\\n\\nvariable funding requirements of subsidiaries. Where\\n\\nregulations, time zone differences or other business\\n\\nconsiderations make Parent funding impractical, certain other\\n\\nsubsidiaries may issue their own debt.\\n\\nWe fund a substantial portion of our lending activities\\n\\nthrough our deposits, which were $1.93 trillion and $2.1 trillion\\n\\nat December 31, 2022 and 2021. Deposits are primarily\\n\\ngenerated by our Consumer Banking, GWIM and Global Banking\\n\\nsegments. These deposits are diversified by clients, product\\n\\ntype and geography, and the majority of our U.S. deposits are\\n\\ninsured by the FDIC. We consider a substantial portion of our\\n\\ndeposits to be a stable, low-cost and consistent source of\\n\\nfunding. We believe this deposit funding is generally less\\n\\nsensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility or changes\\n\\nin our credit ratings than wholesale funding sources. Our lending\\n\\nactivities may also be financed through secured borrowings,\\n\\nincluding credit card securitizations and securitizations with\\n\\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises (GSE), the Federal Housing\\n\\nAdministration (FHA) and private-label investors, as well as FHLB\\n\\nloans.\\n\\nOur trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily\\n\\nfunded on a secured basis through securities lending and\\n\\nrepurchase agreements, and these amounts will vary based on\\n\\ncustomer activity and market conditions. We believe funding\\n\\nthese activities in the secured financing markets is more costefficient and less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings than\\n\\nunsecured financing. Repurchase agreements are generally\\n\\nshort-term and often overnight. Disruptions in secured financing\\n\\nmarkets for financial institutions have occurred in prior market\\n\\ncycles which resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant\\n\\nreductions in the availability of such financing. We manage the\\n\\nliquidity risks arising from secured funding by sourcing funding\\n\\nglobally from a diverse group of counterparties, providing a\\n\\nrange of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations,\\n\\nwhen appropriate. For more information on secured financing\\n\\nagreements, see Note 10 – Securities Financing Agreements,\\n\\nShort-term Borrowings, Collateral and Restricted Cash to the\\n\\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\\n\\nTotal long-term debt decreased $4.1 billion to $276.0 billion\\n\\nduring 2022 primarily due to debt maturities, redemptions and\\n\\nvaluation adjustments, partially offset by debt issuances. We\\n\\nmay, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments\\n\\nin various transactions, depending on market conditions,\\n\\nliquidity and other factors. Our other regulated entities may also\\n\\nmake markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for\\n\\ninvestors.\\n\\nDuring 2022, we issued $66.0 billion of long-term debt\\n\\nconsisting of $44.2 billion of notes issued by Bank of America\\n\\nCorporation, substantially all of which were TLAC compliant,\\n\\nBank of America 2022 103\\n\\n$10.0 billion of notes issued by Bank of America, N.A. and\\n\\n$11.8 billion of other debt. During 2021, we issued $76.7\\n\\nbillion of long-term debt consisting of $56.2 billion of notes\\n\\nissued by Bank of America Corporation, substantially all of\\n\\nwhich were TLAC compliant, $8 billion of notes issued by Bank\\n\\nof America, N.A. and $12.5 billion of other debt.\\n\\nDuring 2022, we had total long-term debt maturities and\\n\\nredemptions in the aggregate of $33.3 billion consisting of\\n\\n$19.8 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $9.9 billion for\\n\\nBank of America, N.A. and $3.6 billion of other debt. During\\n\\n2021, we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions\\n\\nin the aggregate of $46.4 billion consisting of $24.4 billion for\\n\\nBank of America Corporation, $10.4 billion for Bank of America,\\n\\nN.A. and $11.6 billion of other debt.\\n\\nAt December 31, 2022, Bank of America Corporation\\'s\\n\\nsenior notes of $205.9 billion included $179.1 billion of\\n\\noutstanding notes that are both TLAC eligible and callable at\\n\\nleast one year before their stated maturities. Of these senior\\n\\nnotes, $16.6 billion will be callable and become TLAC ineligible\\n\\nduring 2023, and $21.4 billion, $21.3 billion, $16.0 billion and\\n\\n$24.4 billion will do so during each of 2024 through 2027,\\n\\nrespectively, and $79.4 billion thereafter.\\n\\nWe issue long-term unsecured debt in a variety of maturities\\n\\nand currencies to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain\\n\\nan appropriate maturity profile. While the cost and availability of\\n\\nunsecured funding may be negatively impacted by general\\n\\nmarket conditions or by matters specific to the financial\\n\\nservices industry or the Corporation, we seek to mitigate\\n\\nrefinancing risk by actively managing the amount of our\\n\\nborrowings that we anticipate will mature within any month or\\n\\nquarter. We may issue unsecured debt in the form of structured\\n\\nnotes for client purposes, certain of which qualify as TLACeligible debt. During 2022, we issued $12.5 billion of structured\\n\\nnotes, which are debt obligations that pay investors returns\\n\\nlinked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or\\n\\ncommodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to\\n\\npay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in\\n\\nthe underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective,\\n\\nthe cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We\\n\\ncould be required to settle certain structured note obligations\\n\\nfor cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain\\n\\ncircumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning\\n\\npurposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such\\n\\nborrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or\\n\\nredemption date.\\n\\nSubstantially all of our senior and subordinated debt\\n\\nobligations contain no provisions that could trigger a\\n\\nrequirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral\\n\\nsupport, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or\\n\\ncreate additional financial obligations upon an adverse change\\n\\nin our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or\\n\\nstock price. For more information on long-term debt funding,\\n\\nincluding issuances and maturities and redemptions, see Note\\n\\n11 – Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\\n\\nWe use derivative transactions to manage the duration,\\n\\ninterest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering\\n\\nthe characteristics of the assets they are funding. For more\\n\\ninformation on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk\\n\\nManagement for the Banking Book on page 126.\\n\\nUninsured Deposits\\n\\nThe FDIC insures the Corporation’s U.S. deposits up to\\n\\n$250,000 per depositor, per insured bank for each account\\n\\nownership category, and various country-specific funds insure\\n\\nnon-U.S. deposits up to specified limits. Deposits that exceed\\n\\n104 Bank of America 2022\\n\\ninsurance limits are uninsured. At December 31, 2022, the\\n\\nCorporation’s deposits totaled $1.9 trillion, of which total\\n\\nestimated uninsured U.S. and non-U.S. deposits were $617.6\\n\\nbillion and $102.8 billion. At December 31, 2021, the\\n\\nCorporation’s deposits totaled $2.1 trillion, of which total\\n\\nestimated uninsured U.S. and non-U.S. deposits were $701.4\\n\\nbillion and $111.9 billion.\\n\\nTable 17 presents information about the Corporation’s total\\n\\nestimated uninsured time deposits.

We periodically review\\n\\nand test the contingency funding plans to validate efficacy and\\n\\nassess readiness.\\n\\nOur U.S. bank subsidiaries can access contingency funding\\n\\nthrough the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Certain non-U.S.\\n\\nsubsidiaries have access to central bank facilities in the\\n\\njurisdictions in which they operate. While we do not rely on\\n\\nthese sources in our liquidity modeling, we maintain the\\n\\npolicies, procedures and governance processes that would\\n\\nenable us to access these sources if necessary.\\n\\nCredit Ratings\\n\\nOur borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are impacted\\n\\nby our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important\\n\\nto customers or counterparties when we compete in certain\\n\\nmarkets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions,\\n\\nincluding over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. Thus, it is our\\n\\nobjective to maintain high-quality credit ratings, and\\n\\nmanagement maintains an active dialogue with the major rating\\n\\nagencies.\\n\\nCredit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating\\n\\nagencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or\\n\\nsecurities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings,\\n\\npreferred stock and other securities, including asset\\n\\nsecuritizations. Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review\\n\\nby the rating agencies, and they consider a number of factors,\\n\\nincluding our own financial strength, performance, prospects\\n\\nand operations as well as factors not under our control. The\\n\\nrating agencies could make adjustments to our ratings at any\\n\\ntime, and they provide no assurances that they will maintain our\\n\\nratings at current levels.\\n\\nOther factors that influence our credit ratings include\\n\\nchanges to the rating agencies’ methodologies for our industry\\n\\nor certain security types; the rating agencies’ assessment of the\\n\\ngeneral operating environment for financial services companies;\\n\\nour relative positions in the markets in which we compete; our\\n\\nvarious risk exposures and risk management policies and\\n\\nactivities; pending litigation and other contingencies or potential\\n\\ntail risks; our reputation; our liquidity position, diversity of\\n\\nfunding sources and funding costs; the current and expected\\n\\nlevel and volatility of our earnings; our capital position and\\n\\ncapital management practices; our corporate governance; the\\n\\nsovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government; current or future\\n\\nregulatory and legislative initiatives; and the agencies’ views on\\n\\nwhether the U.S. government would provide meaningful support\\n\\nto the Corporation or its subsidiaries in a crisis.\\n\\nOn September 19, 2022, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) affirmed the\\n\\nlong-term and short-term senior debt ratings of the Corporation.\\n\\nFitch also affirmed and withdrew the long-term and short-term\\n\\nratings on certain subsidiaries, as they are no longer considered\\n\\nrelevant to the agency’s coverage.\\n\\nOn January 23, 2023, Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s)\\n\\nplaced the long-term rating of the Corporation as well as the\\n\\nlong-term rating of its rated subsidiaries, including BANA, on\\n\\nreview for upgrade.

In addition, under the\\n\\nterms of certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading\\n\\nagreements, in the event of downgrades of our or our rated\\n\\nsubsidiaries’ credit ratings, the counterparties to those\\n\\nagreements may require us to provide additional collateral, or to\\n\\nterminate these contracts or agreements, which could cause us\\n\\nto sustain losses and/or adversely impact our liquidity.

Credit risk\\n\\ncan also arise from operational failures that result in an\\n\\nerroneous advance, commitment or investment of funds. We\\n\\ndefine the credit exposure to a borrower or counterparty as the\\n\\nloss potential arising from all product classifications including\\n\\nloans and leases, deposit overdrafts, derivatives, assets heldfor-sale and unfunded lending commitments, which include loan\\n\\ncommitments, letters of credit and financial guarantees.\\n\\nDerivative positions are recorded at fair value, and assets heldfor-sale are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or\\n\\n106 Bank of America 2022\\n\\nfair value. Certain loans and unfunded commitments are\\n\\naccounted for under the fair value option. Credit risk for\\n\\ncategories of assets carried at fair value is not accounted for as\\n\\npart of the allowance for credit losses but as part of the fair\\n\\nvalue adjustments recorded in earnings. For derivative positions,\\n\\nour credit risk is measured as the net cost in the event the\\n\\ncounterparties with contracts in which we are in a gain position\\n\\nfail to perform under the terms of those contracts. We use the\\n\\ncurrent fair value to represent credit exposure without giving\\n\\nconsideration to future mark-to-market changes. The credit risk\\n\\namounts take into consideration the effects of legally\\n\\nenforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral. Our\\n\\nconsumer and commercial credit extension and review\\n\\nprocedures encompass funded and unfunded credit exposures.\\n\\nFor more information on derivatives and credit extension\\n\\ncommitments, see Note 3 – Derivatives and Note 12 –\\n\\nCommitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial\\n\\nStatements.\\n\\nWe manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the\\n\\nborrower or counterparty, repayment sources, the nature of\\n\\nunderlying collateral and other support given current events,\\n\\nconditions and expectations. We classify our portfolios as either\\n\\nconsumer or commercial and monitor credit risk in each as\\n\\ndiscussed below.\\n\\nWe refine our underwriting and credit risk management\\n\\npractices as well as credit standards to meet the changing\\n\\neconomic environment. To mitigate losses and enhance\\n\\ncustomer support in our consumer businesses, we have in\\n\\nplace collection programs and loan modification and customer\\n\\nassistance infrastructures. We utilize a number of actions to\\n\\nmitigate losses in the commercial businesses including\\n\\nincreasing the frequency and intensity of portfolio monitoring,\\n\\nhedging activity and our practice of transferring management of\\n\\ndeteriorating commercial exposures to independent special\\n\\nasset officers as credits enter criticized categories.\\n\\nDuring 2022, asset quality generally improved compared to\\n\\n2021. Our 2022 net charge-off ratio remained near historic\\n\\nlows, and nonperforming loans and commercial reservable\\n\\ncriticized utilized exposure decreased compared to 2021, which\\n\\nwas partially offset by an increase in reservable criticized\\n\\nexposure associated with our direct exposure to Russia as a\\n\\nresult of the Russia/Ukraine conflict. While uncertainty around\\n\\nthe pandemic has diminished, uncertainty remains regarding\\n\\nbroader economic impacts as a result of inflationary pressures,\\n\\nrising rates and the current geopolitical situation and could lead\\n\\nto adverse impacts to credit quality metrics in future periods.\\n\\nFor information on our credit risk management activities, see\\n\\nConsumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management below, Commercial\\n\\nPortfolio Credit Risk Management on page 111, Non-U.S.\\n\\nPortfolio on page 117, Allowance for Credit Losses on page\\n\\n120, and Note 5 – Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance\\n\\nfor Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Risk Factors of our 2022 Annual\\n\\nReport on Form 10-K.\\n\\nConsumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management\\n\\nCredit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with\\n\\ninitial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower’s credit\\n\\ncycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential\\n\\njudgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management\\n\\nincluding underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting\\n\\ncredit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics\\n\\nto quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are\\n\\nbuilt using detailed behavioral information from external\\n\\nsources, such as credit bureaus, and/or internal historical\\n\\nexperience and are a component of our consumer credit risk\\n\\nmanagement process. These models are used in part to assist\\n\\nin making both new and ongoing credit decisions as well as\\n\\nportfolio management strategies, including authorizations and\\n\\nline management, collection practices and strategies, and\\n\\ndetermination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and\\n\\nallocated capital for credit risk.\\n\\ndecreases from consumer real estate loan sales, partially offset\\n\\nby increases from loans whose prior-period deferrals expired\\n\\nand were modified in troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) during\\n\\nthe first quarter of 2022.\\n\\nThe consumer allowance for loan and lease losses increased\\n\\n$204 million during 2022 to $7.2 billion.

As\\n\\npart of the overall credit risk assessment, our commercial credit\\n\\nexposures are assigned a risk rating and are subject to approval\\n\\nbased on defined credit approval standards. Subsequent to loan\\n\\norigination, risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis, and\\n\\nif necessary, adjusted to reflect changes in the financial\\n\\ncondition, cash flow, risk profile or outlook of a borrower or\\n\\ncounterparty. In making credit decisions, we consider risk rating,\\n\\ncollateral, country, industry and single-name concentration limits\\n\\nwhile also balancing these considerations with the total\\n\\nborrower or counterparty relationship. We use a variety of tools\\n\\nto continuously monitor the ability of a borrower or counterparty\\n\\nto perform under its obligations. We use risk rating aggregations\\n\\nCommercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal\\n\\nthat concentrations of credit exposure continue to be aligned\\n\\nwith our risk appetite. We review, measure and manage\\n\\nconcentrations of credit exposure by industry, product,\\n\\ngeography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review,\\n\\nmeasure and manage commercial real estate loans by\\n\\ngeographic location and property type. In addition, within our\\n\\nnon-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by\\n\\ncountry. Tables 33, 36 and 39 summarize our concentrations.\\n\\nWe also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan\\n\\nsales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage\\n\\nthe size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For\\n\\nmore information on our industry concentrations, see Table 36\\n\\nBank of America 2022 111\\n\\nand Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Industry\\n\\nConcentrations on page 115.\\n\\nWe account for certain large corporate loans and loan\\n\\ncommitments, including issued but unfunded letters of credit\\n\\nwhich are considered utilized for credit risk management\\n\\npurposes, that exceed our single-name credit risk concentration\\n\\nguidelines under the fair value option. Lending commitments,\\n\\nboth funded and unfunded, are actively managed and\\n\\nmonitored, and as appropriate, credit risk for these lending\\n\\nrelationships may be mitigated through the use of credit\\n\\nderivatives, with our credit view and market perspectives\\n\\ndetermining the size and timing of the hedging activity. In\\n\\naddition, we purchase credit protection to cover the funded\\n\\nportion as well as the unfunded portion of certain other credit\\n\\nexposures. To lessen the cost of obtaining our desired credit\\n\\nprotection levels, credit exposure may be added within an\\n\\nindustry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection.\\n\\nThese credit derivatives do not meet the requirements for\\n\\ntreatment as accounting hedges. They are carried at fair value\\n\\nwith changes in fair value recorded in other income.\\n\\nIn addition, we are a member of various securities and\\n\\nderivative exchanges and clearinghouses, both in the U.S. and\\n\\nother countries. As a member, we may be required to pay a prorata share of the losses incurred by some of these\\n\\norganizations as a result of another member default and under\\n\\nother loss scenarios. For more information, see Note 12 –\\n\\nCommitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial\\n\\nStatements.\\n\\ncommercial loans and leases increased $45.9 billion during\\n\\n2022 due to growth in commercial and industrial, primarily in\\n\\nGlobal Banking.

We execute the\\n\\nmajority of our credit derivative trades in the OTC market with\\n\\nlarge, multinational financial institutions, including brokerdealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of other\\n\\ninvestors. Because these transactions are executed in the OTC\\n\\nmarket, we are subject to settlement risk. We are also subject\\n\\nto credit risk in the event that these counterparties fail to\\n\\nperform under the terms of these contracts. In order to properly\\n\\nreflect counterparty credit risk, we record counterparty credit risk\\n\\nvaluation adjustments on certain derivative assets, including our\\n\\npurchased credit default protection. In most cases, credit\\n\\nderivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis.\\n\\nTherefore, events such as a credit downgrade, depending on the\\n\\nultimate rating level, or a breach of credit covenants would\\n\\ntypically require an increase in the amount of collateral required\\n\\nby the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow us to take\\n\\nadditional protective measures such as early termination of all\\n\\nNon-U.S. Portfolio\\n\\nOur non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country\\n\\nrisk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable\\n\\neconomic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social\\n\\ninstability and changes in government policies. A risk\\n\\nmanagement framework is in place to measure, monitor and\\n\\nmanage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct\\n\\nrisk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to\\n\\nindirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on\\n\\nsecured financing transactions or related to client clearing\\n\\nactivities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal\\n\\ncourse of business through credit, market and operational risk\\n\\ngovernance rather than through country risk governance.\\n\\nTable 39 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures\\n\\nat December 31, 2022. These exposures accounted for 89\\n\\npercent of our total non-U.S. exposure at both December 31,\\n\\n2022 and 2021. Net country exposure for these 20 countries\\n\\nincreased $24.0 billion in 2022 primarily driven by increases in\\n\\nGermany, Japan, Ireland, India and Switzerland, partially offset\\n\\nby decreases in China, Belgium, Australia and Singapore.\\n\\nNon-U.S. exposure is presented on an internal risk\\n\\nmanagement basis and includes sovereign and non-sovereign\\n\\ncredit exposure, securities and other investments issued by or\\n\\ndomiciled in countries other than the U.S.\\n\\nFunded loans and loan equivalents include loans, leases,\\n\\nand other extensions of credit and funds, including letters of\\n\\ncredit and due from placements. Unfunded commitments are\\n\\nthe undrawn portion of legally binding commitments related to\\n\\nloans and loan equivalents. Net counterparty exposure includes\\n\\nthe fair value of derivatives, including the counterparty risk\\n\\nassociated with credit default swaps (CDS), and secured\\n\\nfinancing transactions. Securities and other investments are\\n\\ncarried at fair value and long securities exposures are netted\\n\\nagainst short exposures with the same underlying issuer to, but\\n\\nnot below, zero.

This risk is inherent in the financial\\n\\ninstruments associated with our operations, primarily within our\\n\\nGlobal Markets segment. We are also exposed to these risks in\\n\\nother areas of the Corporation (e.g., our ALM activities). In the\\n\\nevent of market stress, these risks could have a material\\n\\nimpact on our results. For more information, see Interest Rate\\n\\nRisk Management for the Banking Book on page 126.\\n\\nOur traditional banking loan and deposit products are nontrading positions and are generally reported at amortized cost\\n\\nfor assets or the amount owed for liabilities (historical cost).\\n\\nHowever, these positions are still subject to changes in\\n\\neconomic value based on varying market conditions, with one of\\n\\nthe primary risks being changes in the levels of interest rates.\\n\\nThe risk of adverse changes in the economic value of our nontrading positions arising from changes in interest rates is\\n\\nmanaged through our ALM activities. We have elected to\\n\\naccount for certain assets and liabilities under the fair value\\n\\noption.\\n\\nOur trading positions are reported at fair value with changes\\n\\nreflected in income. Trading positions are subject to various\\n\\nchanges in market-based risk factors. The majority of this risk is\\n\\ngenerated by our activities in the interest rate, foreign exchange,\\n\\ncredit, equity and commodities markets. In addition, the values\\n\\nof assets and liabilities could change due to market liquidity,\\n\\ncorrelations across markets and expectations of market\\n\\nvolatility. We seek to manage these risk exposures by using a\\n\\nvariety of techniques that encompass a broad range of financial\\n\\ninstruments. The key risk management techniques are\\n\\ndiscussed in more detail in the Trading Risk Management\\n\\nsection.\\n\\nGRM is responsible for providing senior management with a\\n\\nclear and comprehensive understanding of the trading risks to\\n\\nwhich we are exposed. These responsibilities include ownership\\n\\nof market risk policy, developing and maintaining quantitative\\n\\nrisk models, calculating aggregated risk measures, establishing\\n\\nand monitoring position limits consistent with risk appetite,\\n\\nconducting daily reviews and analysis of trading inventory,\\n\\napproving material risk exposures and fulfilling regulatory\\n\\nrequirements. Market risks that impact businesses outside of\\n\\nGlobal Markets are monitored and governed by their respective\\n\\ngovernance functions.\\n\\nModel risk is the potential for adverse consequences from\\n\\ndecisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and\\n\\nreports. Given that models are used across the Corporation,\\n\\nmodel risk impacts all risk types including credit, market and\\n\\noperational risks. The Enterprise Model Risk Policy defines\\n\\nmodel risk standards, consistent with our Risk Framework and\\n\\nrisk appetite, prevailing regulatory guidance and industry best\\n\\npractice. All models, including risk management, valuation and\\n\\nregulatory capital models, must meet certain validation criteria,\\n\\nincluding effective challenge of the conceptual soundness of the\\n\\nmodel, independent model testing and ongoing monitoring\\n\\nthrough outcomes analysis and benchmarking. The Enterprise\\n\\nModel Risk Committee, a subcommittee of the MRC, oversees\\n\\nthat model standards are consistent with model risk\\n\\nrequirements and monitors the effective challenge in the model\\n\\nvalidation process across the Corporation.\\n\\nInterest Rate Risk\\n\\nInterest rate risk represents exposures to instruments whose\\n\\nvalues vary with the level or volatility of interest rates. These\\n\\ninstruments include, but are not limited to, loans, debt\\n\\n122 Bank of America 2022\\n\\nsecurities, certain trading-related assets and liabilities,\\n\\ndeposits, borrowings and derivatives. Hedging instruments used\\n\\nto mitigate these risks include derivatives such as options,\\n\\nfutures, forwards and swaps.\\n\\nForeign Exchange Risk\\n\\nForeign exchange risk represents exposures to changes in the\\n\\nvalues of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in\\n\\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar. The types of instruments\\n\\nexposed to this risk include investments in non-U.S.\\n\\nsubsidiaries, foreign currency-denominated loans and securities,\\n\\nfuture cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign\\n\\nexchange transactions, foreign currency-denominated debt and\\n\\nvarious foreign exchange derivatives whose values fluctuate with\\n\\nchanges in the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or\\n\\nnon-U.S. interest rates. Hedging instruments used to mitigate\\n\\nthis risk include foreign exchange options, currency swaps,\\n\\nfutures, forwards, and foreign currency-denominated debt and\\n\\ndeposits.\\n\\nMortgage Risk\\n\\nMortgage risk represents exposures to changes in the values of\\n\\nmortgage-related instruments. The values of these instruments\\n\\nare sensitive to prepayment rates, mortgage rates, agency debt\\n\\nratings, default, market liquidity, government participation and\\n\\ninterest rate volatility. Our exposure to these instruments takes\\n\\nseveral forms. For example, we trade and engage in marketmaking activities in a variety of mortgage securities including\\n\\nwhole loans, pass-through certificates, commercial mortgages\\n\\nand collateralized mortgage obligations including collateralized\\n\\ndebt obligations using mortgages as underlying collateral. In\\n\\naddition, we originate a variety of MBS, which involves the\\n\\naccumulation of mortgage-related loans in anticipation of\\n\\neventual securitization, and we may hold positions in mortgage\\n\\nsecurities and residential mortgage loans as part of the ALM\\n\\nportfolio. We also record MSRs as part of our mortgage\\n\\norigination activities. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this\\n\\nrisk include derivatives such as options, swaps, futures and\\n\\nforwards as well as securities including MBS and U.S. Treasury\\n\\nsecurities. For more information, see Mortgage Banking Risk\\n\\nManagement on page 127.\\n\\nEquity Market Risk\\n\\nEquity market risk represents exposures to securities that\\n\\nrepresent an ownership interest in a corporation in the form of\\n\\ndomestic and foreign common stock or other equity-linked\\n\\ninstruments. Instruments that would lead to this exposure\\n\\ninclude, but are not limited to, the following: common stock,\\n\\nexchange-traded funds, American Depositary Receipts,\\n\\nconvertible bonds, listed equity options (puts and calls), OTC\\n\\nequity options, equity total return swaps, equity index futures\\n\\nand other equity derivative products. Hedging instruments used\\n\\nto mitigate this risk include options, futures, swaps, convertible\\n\\nbonds and cash positions.\\n\\nCommodity Risk\\n\\nCommodity risk represents exposures to instruments traded in\\n\\nthe petroleum, natural gas, power and metals markets. These\\n\\ninstruments consist primarily of futures, forwards, swaps and\\n\\noptions. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include\\n\\noptions, futures and swaps in the same or similar commodity\\n\\nproduct, as well as cash positions.\\n\\nIssuer Credit Risk\\n\\nIssuer credit risk represents exposures to changes in the\\n\\ncreditworthiness of individual issuers or groups of issuers. Our\\n\\nportfolio is exposed to issuer credit risk where the value of an\\n\\nasset may be adversely impacted by changes in the levels of\\n\\ncredit spreads, by credit migration or by defaults. Hedging\\n\\ninstruments used to mitigate this risk include bonds, CDS and\\n\\nother credit fixed-income instruments.\\n\\nMarket Liquidity Risk\\n\\nMarket liquidity risk represents the risk that the level of\\n\\nexpected market activity changes dramatically and, in certain\\n\\ncases, may even cease. This exposes us to the risk that we will\\n\\nnot be able to transact business and execute trades in an\\n\\norderly manner which may impact our results. This impact could\\n\\nbe further exacerbated if expected hedging or pricing\\n\\ncorrelations are compromised by disproportionate demand or\\n\\nlack of demand for certain instruments. We utilize various risk\\n\\nmitigating techniques as discussed in more detail in Trading\\n\\nRisk Management.\\n\\nTrading Risk Management\\n\\nTo evaluate risks in our trading activities, we focus on the actual\\n\\nand potential volatility of revenues generated by individual\\n\\npositions as well as portfolios of positions. Various techniques\\n\\nand procedures are utilized to enable the most complete\\n\\nunderstanding of these risks. Quantitative measures of market\\n\\nrisk are evaluated on a daily basis from a single position to the\\n\\nportfolio of the Corporation. These measures include\\n\\nsensitivities of positions to various market risk factors, such as\\n\\nthe potential impact on revenue from a one basis point change\\n\\nin interest rates, and statistical measures utilizing both actual\\n\\nand hypothetical market moves, such as VaR and stress\\n\\ntesting. Periods of extreme market stress influence the\\n\\nreliability of these techniques to varying degrees. Qualitative\\n\\nevaluations of market risk utilize the suite of quantitative risk\\n\\nmeasures while understanding each of their respective\\n\\nlimitations. Additionally, risk managers independently evaluate\\n\\nthe risk of the portfolios under the current market environment\\n\\nand potential future environments.\\n\\nVaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk as it\\n\\nallows the aggregation of market risk factors, including the\\n\\neffects of portfolio diversification. A VaR model simulates the\\n\\nvalue of a portfolio under a range of scenarios in order to\\n\\ngenerate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR\\n\\nrepresents the loss a portfolio is not expected to exceed more\\n\\nthan a certain number of times per period, based on a specified\\n\\nholding period, confidence level and window of historical data.\\n\\nWe use one VaR model consistently across the trading\\n\\nportfolios and it uses a historical simulation approach based on\\n\\na three-year window of historical data. Our primary VaR statistic\\n\\nis equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level, which means\\n\\nthat for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be\\n\\nlosses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading\\n\\ndays.\\n\\nWithin any VaR model, there are significant and numerous\\n\\nassumptions that will differ from company to company. The\\n\\naccuracy of a VaR model depends on the availability and quality\\n\\nof historical data for each of the risk factors in the portfolio. A\\n\\nVaR model may require additional modeling assumptions for\\n\\nnew products that do not have the necessary historical market\\n\\ndata or for less liquid positions for which accurate daily prices\\n\\nare not consistently available. For positions with insufficient\\n\\nhistorical data for the VaR calculation, the process for\\n\\nestablishing an appropriate proxy is based on fundamental and\\n\\nstatistical analysis of the new product or less liquid position.\\n\\nThis analysis identifies reasonable alternatives that replicate\\n\\nboth the expected volatility and correlation to other market risk\\n\\nfactors that the missing data would be expected to experience.\\n\\nVaR may not be indicative of realized revenue volatility as\\n\\nchanges in market conditions or in the composition of the\\n\\nportfolio can have a material impact on the results. In particular,\\n\\nthe historical data used for the VaR calculation might indicate\\n\\nhigher or lower levels of portfolio diversification than will be\\n\\nexperienced. In order for the VaR model to reflect current market\\n\\nconditions, we update the historical data underlying our VaR\\n\\nmodel on a weekly basis, or more frequently during periods of\\n\\nmarket stress, and regularly review the assumptions underlying\\n\\nthe model. A minor portion of risks related to our trading\\n\\npositions is not included in VaR. These risks are reviewed as\\n\\npart of our ICAAP. For more information regarding ICAAP, see\\n\\nCapital Management on page 96.\\n\\nGRM continually reviews, evaluates and enhances our VaR\\n\\nmodel so that it reflects the material risks in our trading\\n\\nportfolio. Changes to the VaR model are reviewed and approved\\n\\nprior to implementation and any material changes are reported\\n\\nto management through the appropriate management\\n\\ncommittees.\\n\\nTrading limits on quantitative risk measures, including VaR,\\n\\nare independently set by Global Markets Risk Management and\\n\\nreviewed on a regular basis so that trading limits remain\\n\\nrelevant and within our overall risk appetite for market risks.\\n\\nTrading limits are reviewed in the context of market liquidity,\\n\\nvolatility and strategic business priorities. Trading limits are set\\n\\nat both a granular level to allow for extensive coverage of risks\\n\\nas well as at aggregated portfolios to account for correlations\\n\\namong risk factors. All trading limits are approved at least\\n\\nannually. Approved trading limits are stored and tracked in a\\n\\ncentralized limits management system. Trading limit excesses\\n\\nare communicated to management for review. Certain\\n\\nquantitative market risk measures and corresponding limits\\n\\nhave been identified as critical in the Corporation’s Risk\\n\\nAppetite Statement. These risk appetite limits are reported on a\\n\\ndaily basis and are approved at least annually by the ERC and\\n\\nthe Board.\\n\\nIn periods of market stress, Global Markets senior leadership\\n\\ncommunicates daily to discuss losses, key risk positions and\\n\\nany limit excesses. As a result of this process, the businesses\\n\\nmay selectively reduce risk.\\n\\nTable 43 presents the total market-based portfolio VaR,\\n\\nwhich is the combination of the total covered positions (and\\n\\nless liquid trading positions) portfolio and the fair value option\\n\\nportfolio. Covered positions are defined by regulatory standards\\n\\nas trading assets and liabilities, both on- and off-balance sheet,\\n\\nthat meet a defined set of specifications. These specifications\\n\\nidentify the most liquid trading positions which are intended to\\n\\nbe held for a short-term horizon and where we are able to hedge\\n\\nthe material risk elements in a two-way market. Positions in less\\n\\nliquid markets, or where there are restrictions on the ability to\\n\\ntrade the positions, typically do not qualify as covered positions.\\n\\nForeign exchange and commodity positions are always\\n\\nconsidered covered positions, except for structural foreign\\n\\ncurrency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory\\n\\napproval.\\n\\nIn addition, Table 43 presents our fair value option portfolio,\\n\\nwhich includes substantially all of the funded and unfunded\\n\\nexposures for which we elect the fair value option, and their\\n\\ncorresponding hedges. Additionally, market risk VaR for trading\\n\\nactivities as presented in Table 43 differs from VaR used for\\n\\nregulatory capital calculations due to the holding period being\\n\\nBank of America 2022 123\\n\\nused. The holding period for VaR used for regulatory capital\\n\\ncalculations is 10 days, while for the market risk VaR presented\\n\\nbelow, it is one day. Both measures utilize the same process\\n\\nand methodology.\\n\\nThe total market-based portfolio VaR results in Table 43\\n\\ninclude market risk to which we are exposed from all business\\n\\nsegments, excluding credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and\\n\\nrelated hedges. The majority of this portfolio is within the Global\\n\\nMarkets segment.\\n\\nTable 43 presents year-end, average, high and low daily\\n\\ntrading VaR for 2022 and 2021 using a 99 percent confidence\\n\\nlevel. The amounts disclosed in Table 43 and Table 44 align to\\n\\nthe view of covered positions used in the Basel 3 capital\\n\\ncalculations. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are\\n\\nalways considered covered positions, regardless of trading or\\n\\nbanking treatment for the trade, except for structural foreign\\n\\ncurrency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory\\n\\napproval.\\n\\nThe annual average of total covered positions and less liquid\\n\\ntrading positions portfolio VaR increased for 2022 compared to\\n\\n2021 driven by heightened market volatility and reduced\\n\\ndiversification across asset classes.\\n\\nTable 43 Market Risk VaR for Trading Activities\\n\\n2021\\n\\n2022\\n\\nYear\\n\\nEnd\\n\\n(Dollars in millions)\\n\\nForeign exchange\\n\\nInterest rate\\n\\nCredit\\n\\nEquity\\n\\nCommodities\\n\\nPortfolio diversification\\n\\nAverage\\n\\n$\\n\\n39\\n\\n56\\n\\n106\\n\\n33\\n\\n27\\n\\nn/a\\n\\n140\\n\\nn/a\\n\\nLow\\n\\n$\\n\\n12\\n\\n24\\n\\n52\\n\\n12\\n\\n7\\n\\nn/a\\n\\n42\\n\\nn/a\\n\\n$\\n\\n11\\n\\n54\\n\\n73\\n\\n21\\n\\n6\\n\\n(114)\\n\\n51\\n\\n8\\n\\n$\\n\\nAverage\\n\\n12\\n\\n40\\n\\n69\\n\\n24\\n\\n8\\n\\n(100)\\n\\n53\\n\\n20\\n\\n$\\n\\nHigh (1)\\n\\n21\\n\\n80\\n\\n84\\n\\n35\\n\\n28\\n\\nn/a\\n\\n85\\n\\nn/a\\n\\nLow (1)\\n\\n$\\n\\n5\\n\\n16\\n\\n53\\n\\n19\\n\\n4\\n\\nn/a\\n\\n34\\n\\nn/a\\n\\nTotal covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio\\n\\nFair value option loans\\n\\nFair value option hedges\\n\\nFair value option portfolio diversification\\n\\n130\\n\\n48\\n\\n16\\n\\n(38)\\n\\n108\\n\\n51\\n\\n17\\n\\n(36)\\n\\n236\\n\\n65\\n\\n24\\n\\nn/a\\n\\n61\\n\\n37\\n\\n13\\n\\nn/a\\n\\n59\\n\\n51\\n\\n15\\n\\n(27)\\n\\n73\\n\\n50\\n\\n16\\n\\n(32)\\n\\n125\\n\\n65\\n\\n20\\n\\nn/a\\n\\n46\\n\\n31\\n\\n11\\n\\nn/a\\n\\nTotal fair value option portfolio\\n\\nPortfolio diversification\\n\\n26\\n\\n9\\n\\n165\\n\\n32\\n\\n(11)\\n\\n129\\n\\n44\\n\\nn/a\\n\\n287\\n\\n23\\n\\nn/a\\n\\n70\\n\\n39\\n\\n(24)\\n\\n74\\n\\n34\\n\\n(10)\\n\\n97\\n\\n53\\n\\nn/a\\n\\n169\\n\\n23\\n\\nn/a\\n\\n54\\n\\n$\\n\\n21\\n\\n36\\n\\n71\\n\\n20\\n\\n13\\n\\n(91)\\n\\n70\\n\\n38\\n\\nHigh\\n\\nTotal covered positions portfolio\\n\\nImpact from less liquid exposures (2)\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\nYear\\n\\nEnd\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n38\\n\\n36\\n\\n76\\n\\n18\\n\\n8\\n\\n(81)\\n\\n95\\n\\n35\\n\\nTotal market-based portfolio\\n\\n$\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nThe high and low for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the high and low for the components.

A backtesting excess occurs when a trading loss\\n\\nexceeds the VaR for the corresponding day. These excesses are\\n\\nevaluated to understand the positions and market moves that\\n\\nproduced the trading loss with a goal to help confirm that the\\n\\nVaR methodology accurately represents those losses. We\\n\\nexpect the frequency of trading losses in excess of VaR to be in\\n\\nline with the confidence level of the VaR statistic being tested.\\n\\nFor example, with a 99 percent confidence level, we expect one\\n\\ntrading loss in excess of VaR every 100 days or between two to\\n\\nthree trading losses in excess of VaR over the course of a year.\\n\\nThe number of backtesting excesses observed can differ from\\n\\nthe statistically expected number of excesses if the current level\\n\\nof market volatility is materially different than the level of market\\n\\nvolatility that existed during the three years of historical data\\n\\nused in the VaR calculation.\\n\\nThe trading revenue used for backtesting is defined by\\n\\nregulatory agencies in order to most closely align with the VaR\\n\\ncomponent of the regulatory capital calculation. This revenue\\n\\ndiffers from total trading-related revenue in that it excludes\\n\\nrevenue from trading activities that either do not generate\\n\\nmarket risk or the market risk cannot be included in VaR. Some\\n\\nexamples of the types of revenue excluded for backtesting are\\n\\nfees, commissions, reserves, net interest income and intra-day\\n\\ntrading revenues.\\n\\nWe conduct daily backtesting on the VaR results used for\\n\\nregulatory capital calculations as well as the VaR results for key\\n\\nlegal entities, regions and risk factors.

Also, tradingrelated revenue is dependent on the volume and type of\\n\\ntransactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of\\n\\nprice and rate movements at any given time within the everchanging market environment. Significant daily revenue by\\n\\nbusiness is monitored and the primary drivers of these are\\n\\nreviewed.\\n\\nThe following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading\\n\\nvolatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue\\n\\nfor 2022 and 2021. During 2022, positive trading-related\\n\\nrevenue was recorded for 99 percent of the trading days, of\\n\\nwhich 90 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million,\\n\\nand the largest loss was $9 million. This compares to 2021\\n\\nwhere positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 97\\n\\npercent of the trading days, of which 80 percent were daily\\n\\ntrading gains of over $25 million, and the largest loss was $45\\n\\nmillion.\\n\\nTrading Portfolio Stress Testing\\n\\nBecause the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can\\n\\nexceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical\\n\\nwindow, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario\\n\\nanalysis. This analysis estimates the change in the value of our\\n\\ntrading portfolio that may result from abnormal market\\n\\nmovements.\\n\\nA set of scenarios, categorized as either historical or\\n\\nhypothetical, are computed daily for the overall trading portfolio\\n\\nand individual businesses. These scenarios include shocks to\\n\\nunderlying market risk factors that may be well beyond the\\n\\nshocks found in the historical data used to calculate VaR.\\n\\nBank of America 2022 125\\n\\nHistorical scenarios simulate the impact of the market moves\\n\\nthat occurred during a period of extended historical market\\n\\nstress. Generally, a multi-week period representing the most\\n\\nsevere point during a crisis is selected for each historical\\n\\nscenario. Hypothetical scenarios provide estimated portfolio\\n\\nimpacts from potential future market stress events. Scenarios\\n\\nare reviewed and updated in response to changing positions\\n\\nand new economic or political information. In addition, new or\\n\\nad hoc scenarios are developed to address specific potential\\n\\nmarket events or particular vulnerabilities in the portfolio. The\\n\\nstress tests are reviewed on a regular basis and the results are\\n\\npresented to senior management.\\n\\nStress testing for the trading portfolio is integrated with\\n\\nenterprise-wide stress testing and incorporated into the limits\\n\\nframework. The macroeconomic scenarios used for enterprisewide stress testing purposes differ from the typical trading\\n\\nportfolio scenarios in that they have a longer time horizon and\\n\\nthe results are forecasted over multiple periods for use in\\n\\nconsolidated capital and liquidity planning. For more\\n\\ninformation, see Managing Risk on page 93.\\n\\nInterest Rate Risk Management for the Banking\\n\\nBook\\n\\nThe following discussion presents net interest income for\\n\\nbanking book activities.\\n\\nInterest rate risk represents the most significant market risk\\n\\nexposure to our banking book balance sheet. Interest rate risk\\n\\nis measured as the potential change in net interest income\\n\\ncaused by movements in market interest rates. Client-facing\\n\\nactivities, primarily lending and deposit-taking, create interest\\n\\nrate sensitive positions on our balance sheet.\\n\\nWe prepare forward-looking forecasts of net interest income.\\n\\nThe baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future\\n\\nbusiness growth, ALM positioning and the future direction of\\n\\ninterest rate movements as implied by market-based forward\\n\\ncurves.\\n\\nWe then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative\\n\\ninterest rate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to\\n\\nassess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions. The net\\n\\ninterest income forecast is frequently updated for changing\\n\\nassumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends,\\n\\nmarket conditions and business strategies. Thus, we continually\\n\\nmonitor our banking book balance sheet position in order to\\n\\nmaintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate\\n\\nchanges.\\n\\nThe interest rate scenarios that we analyze incorporate\\n\\nbalance sheet assumptions such as loan and deposit growth\\n\\nand pricing, changes in funding mix, product repricing, maturity\\n\\ncharacteristics and investment securities premium amortization.\\n\\nOur overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that\\n\\nmovements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect\\n\\nearnings and capital.\\n\\nTable 45 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates\\n\\nused in developing the forward curve used in our baseline\\n\\nforecasts at December 31, 2022 and 2021.\\n\\n126 Bank of America 2022\\n\\nTable 45 Forward Rates\\n\\nSpot rates\\n\\n12-month forward rates\\n\\nDecember 31, 2022\\n\\nFederal\\n\\nThree-month\\n\\nFunds\\n\\nLIBOR\\n\\n4.50 %\\n\\n4.77 %\\n\\n4.75\\n\\n4.78\\n\\n10-Year\\n\\nSwap\\n\\n3.84 %\\n\\n3.62\\n\\nSpot rates\\n\\n12-month forward rates\\n\\nDecember 31, 2021\\n\\n0.25 %\\n\\n0.21 %\\n\\n1.00\\n\\n1.07\\n\\n1.58 %\\n\\n1.84\\n\\nTable 46 shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest\\n\\nincome over the next 12 months from December 31, 2022 and\\n\\n2021 resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel\\n\\nshocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically, we\\n\\nevaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in\\n\\nthe context of the current rate environment. The interest rate\\n\\nscenarios also assume U.S. dollar interest rates are floored at\\n\\nzero. Depending on the level of interest rates, Down-rate\\n\\nscenarios may not receive the full impact of the rate shock,\\n\\nparticularly in low rate environments.\\n\\nThe overall decrease in asset sensitivity, as shown in the\\n\\nfollowing table, to Up-rate scenarios was primarily due to an\\n\\nincrease in long-end and short-end rates. We continue to be\\n\\nasset sensitive to a parallel upward move in interest rates with\\n\\nthe majority of that impact coming from the short end of the\\n\\nyield curve. Additionally, higher interest rates negatively impact\\n\\nthe fair value of our debt securities classified as available for\\n\\nsale and adversely affect accumulated OCI and thus capital\\n\\nlevels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under instantaneous\\n\\nupward parallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to Basel 3\\n\\ncapital would be reduced over time by offsetting positive\\n\\nimpacts to net interest income generated from the banking book\\n\\nactivities.

As part of our ALM\\n\\nactivities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and\\n\\ninterest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing\\n\\ninterest rate sensitivity.\\n\\nThe behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast\\n\\nand in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in\\n\\nour projected estimates of net interest income. The sensitivity\\n\\nanalysis in Table 46 assumes no change in deposit portfolio\\n\\nsize or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate\\n\\nenvironments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity\\n\\nresulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing\\n\\ndeposits with higher yielding deposits or market-based funding\\n\\nwould reduce our benefit in those scenarios.\\n\\ninterest rates also impact the value of interest rate lock\\n\\ncommitments (IRLCs) and the related residential first mortgage\\n\\nLHFS between the date of the IRLC and the date the loans are\\n\\nsold to the secondary market. An increase in mortgage interest\\n\\nrates typically leads to a decrease in the value of these\\n\\ninstruments. Conversely, when there is an increase in interest\\n\\nrates, the value of the MSRs will increase driven by lower\\n\\nprepayment expectations. Because the interest rate risks of\\n\\nthese hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall\\n\\nhedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio\\n\\nconsisting of derivative contracts and securities.\\n\\nDuring 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded gains of $78\\n\\nmillion, $39 million and $321 million. For more information on\\n\\nMSRs, see Note 20 – Fair Value Measurements to the\\n\\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\\n\\nInterest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative\\n\\nContracts\\n\\nCompliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions,\\n\\nmaterial financial loss or damage to the reputation of the\\n\\nCorporation arising from the failure of the Corporation to comply\\n\\nwith the requirements of applicable laws, rules, regulations and\\n\\nour internal policies and procedures (collectively, applicable\\n\\nlaws, rules and regulations). We are subject to comprehensive\\n\\nregulation under federal and state laws, rules and regulations in\\n\\nthe U.S. and the laws of the various jurisdictions in which we\\n\\noperate, including those related to financial crimes and antimoney laundering, market conduct, trading activities, fair\\n\\nlending, privacy, data protection and unfair, deceptive or abusive\\n\\nacts or practices.\\n\\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate\\n\\nor failed processes or systems, people or external events, and\\n\\nincludes legal risk. Operational risk may occur anywhere in the\\n\\nCorporation, including third-party business processes, and is not\\n\\nlimited to operations functions. The Corporation faces a number\\n\\nof key operational risks including third-party risk, model risk,\\n\\nconduct risk, technology risk, information security risk and data\\n\\nrisk. Operational risk can result in financial losses and\\n\\nreputational impacts and is a component in the calculation of\\n\\ntotal RWA used in the Basel 3 capital calculation. For more\\n\\ninformation on Basel 3 calculations, see Capital Management\\n\\non page 96.\\n\\nFLUs and control functions are first and foremost\\n\\nresponsible for managing all aspects of their businesses,\\n\\nincluding their compliance and operational risk. FLUs and\\n\\ncontrol functions are required to understand their business\\n\\nprocesses and related risks and controls, including third-party\\n\\ndependencies and the related regulatory requirements, and\\n\\nmonitor and report on the effectiveness of the control\\n\\nenvironment. In order to actively monitor and assess the\\n\\nperformance of their processes and controls, they must conduct\\n\\ncomprehensive quality assurance activities and identify issues\\n\\nand risks to remediate control gaps and weaknesses. FLUs and\\n\\ncontrol functions must also adhere to compliance and\\n\\noperational risk appetite limits to meet strategic, capital and\\n\\nfinancial planning objectives. Finally, FLUs and control functions\\n\\nare responsible for the proactive identification, management\\n\\nand escalation of compliance and operational risks across the\\n\\nCorporation. Collectively, these efforts are important to\\n\\nstrengthen their compliance and operational resiliency, which is\\n\\nthe ability to deliver critical operations through disruption.\\n\\nGlobal\\n\\nCompliance\\n\\nand\\n\\nOperational\\n\\nRisk\\n\\nteams\\n\\nindependently assess compliance and operational risk, monitor\\n\\nbusiness activities and processes and evaluate FLUs and\\n\\ncontrol functions for adherence to applicable laws, rules and\\n\\nregulations, including identifying issues and risks, and reporting\\n\\nWe use interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts\\n\\nin our ALM activities to manage our interest rate and foreign\\n\\nexchange risks. Specifically, we use those derivatives to\\n\\nmanage both the variability in cash flows and changes in fair\\n\\nvalue of various assets and liabilities arising from those risks.\\n\\nOur interest rate derivative contracts are generally non-leveraged\\n\\nswaps tied to various benchmark interest rates and foreign\\n\\nexchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, and our\\n\\nforeign exchange contracts include cross-currency interest rate\\n\\nswaps, foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency\\n\\nforward contracts and options.\\n\\nThe derivatives used in our ALM activities can be split into\\n\\ntwo broad categories: designated accounting hedges and other\\n\\nrisk management derivatives. Designated accounting hedges\\n\\nare primarily used to manage our exposure to interest rates as\\n\\ndescribed in the Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking\\n\\nBook section and are included in the sensitivities presented in\\n\\nTable 46. The Corporation also uses foreign currency derivatives\\n\\nin accounting hedges to manage substantially all of the foreign\\n\\nexchange risk of our foreign operations. By hedging the foreign\\n\\nexchange risk of our foreign operations, the Corporation\\'s\\n\\nmarket risk exposure in this area is not significant.\\n\\nRisk management derivatives are predominantly used to\\n\\nhedge foreign exchange risks related to various foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities and eliminate substantially\\n\\nall foreign currency exposures in the cash flows of the\\n\\nCorporation’s non-trading foreign currency-denominated financial\\n\\ninstruments. These foreign exchange derivatives are sensitive to\\n\\nother market risk exposures such as cross-currency basis\\n\\nspreads and interest rate risk. However, as these features are\\n\\nnot a significant component of these foreign exchange\\n\\nderivatives, the market risk related to this exposure is not\\n\\nsignificant. For more information on the accounting for\\n\\nderivatives, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the Consolidated\\n\\nFinancial Statements.\\n\\nMortgage Banking Risk Management\\n\\nWe originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us\\n\\nto credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We\\n\\ndetermine whether loans will be held for investment or held for\\n\\nsale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity\\n\\nrisks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we\\n\\noriginate.\\n\\nInterest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in the\\n\\nmortgage business.

Corporate Audit\\n\\nprovides an independent assessment and validation through\\n\\ntesting of key compliance and operational risk processes and\\n\\ncontrols across the Corporation.\\n\\nThe Corporation\\'s Global Compliance – Enterprise Policy and\\n\\nOperational Risk Management – Enterprise Policy set the\\n\\nrequirements for reporting compliance and operational risk\\n\\ninformation to executive management as well as the Board or\\n\\nappropriate Board-level committees and reflect Global\\n\\nCompliance and Operational Risk’s responsibilities for\\n\\nconducting independent oversight of the Corporation’s\\n\\ncompliance and operational risk management activities. The\\n\\nBoard provides oversight of compliance risk through its Audit\\n\\nCommittee and the ERC, and operational risk through its ERC.\\n\\nA key operational risk facing the Corporation is information\\n\\nsecurity, which includes cybersecurity. Cybersecurity risk\\n\\nincludes exposure to failures or interruptions of service or\\n\\nsecurity breaches resulting from malicious technological attacks\\n\\nthat impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our or\\n\\nthird parties\\' operations, systems or data. The Corporation\\n\\nseeks to mitigate information security risk and associated\\n\\nreputational and compliance risk by employing a multi-layered\\n\\nand intelligence-led Global Information Security Program focused\\n\\non preparing for, preventing, detecting, mitigating, responding to\\n\\nand recovering from cyber threats and incidents and effectively\\n\\noperating the Corporation’s processes. Additionally, our\\n\\nbusiness continuity policy, standards and procedures are\\n\\ndesigned to maintain the availability of business functions and\\n\\nenable impacted units within the Corporation and third parties\\n\\nto achieve strategic objectives in the event of a cybersecurity\\n\\nincident.\\n\\nThe Global Information Security Program is supported by\\n\\nthree lines of defense. The Global Information Security Team\\n\\nwithin the first line of defense is responsible for the day-to-day\\n\\nmanagement of the Global Information Security Program, which\\n\\nincludes defining policies and procedures to safeguard the\\n\\nCorporation’s information systems and data, conducting\\n\\nvulnerability and third-party information security assessments,\\n\\ninformation security event management (e.g., responding to\\n\\nransomware and distributed denial of service attacks),\\n\\nevaluation of external cyber intelligence, supporting industry\\n\\ncybersecurity efforts and working with governmental agencies,\\n\\nand developing employee training to support adherence to the\\n\\nCorporation’s policies and procedures. As the second line of\\n\\ndefense, Global Compliance and Operational Risk independently\\n\\nassesses, monitors and tests information security risk across\\n\\nthe Corporation, as well as the effectiveness of the Global\\n\\nInformation Security Program. Corporate Audit serves as the\\n\\nthird line of defense, conducting additional independent review\\n\\nand validation of the first-line processes and functions. As part\\n\\nof our Global Information Security Program, we leverage both\\n\\ninternal and external assessments and partnerships with\\n\\nindustry leaders to help approach information security\\n\\nholistically. Additionally the Corporation maintains a\\n\\ncomprehensive enterprise-wide program that defines standards\\n\\nfor the planning, sourcing, management, and oversight of thirdparty relationships and third-party access to its system,\\n\\nfacilities, and/or confidential or proprietary data for a business\\n\\npurpose or supervisory function.\\n\\nThrough established governance structures, we have\\n\\nprocesses to help facilitate appropriate and effective oversight\\n\\nof information security risk. These routines enable our three\\n\\nlines of defense and management to debate information\\n\\nsecurity risks and monitor control performance to allow for\\n\\nfurther escalation to executive management, management and\\n\\n128 Bank of America 2022\\n\\nBoard-level committees or to the Board, as appropriate. The\\n\\nBoard is actively engaged in the oversight of Bank of America’s\\n\\nGlobal Information Security Program and devotes significant\\n\\ntime and attention to the oversight of cybersecurity and\\n\\ninformation security risk. The Board regularly discusses\\n\\ncybersecurity and information security risks with the Chief\\n\\nTechnology and Information Officer and the Chief Information\\n\\nSecurity Officer. Additionally, the ERC receives regular reporting,\\n\\nand reviews and approves the Information Security Program and\\n\\nPolicy on an annual basis.\\n\\nReputational Risk Management\\n\\nReputational risk is the risk that negative perception of the\\n\\nCorporation may adversely impact profitability or operations.\\n\\nReputational risk may result from many of the Corporation’s\\n\\nactivities, including those related to the management of our\\n\\nstrategic, operational, compliance and credit risks.\\n\\nThe Corporation manages reputational risk through\\n\\nestablished policies and controls embedded throughout its\\n\\nbusiness and risk management processes. We proactively\\n\\nmonitor and identify potential reputational risk events and have\\n\\nprocesses established to mitigate reputational risks in a timely\\n\\nmanner. If reputational risk events occur, we focus on\\n\\nremediating the underlying issue and taking action to minimize\\n\\ndamage to the Corporation’s reputation. The Corporation has\\n\\nprocesses and procedures in place to respond to events that\\n\\ngive rise to reputational risk, including educating individuals and\\n\\norganizations that influence public opinion, implementing\\n\\nexternal communication strategies to mitigate the risk, and\\n\\ninforming key stakeholders of potential reputational risks. The\\n\\nCorporation’s organization and governance structure provides\\n\\noversight of reputational risks. Reputational risk reporting is\\n\\nprovided regularly and directly to senior management and the\\n\\nERC, which provides primary oversight of reputational risk. In\\n\\naddition, each FLU has a committee, which includes\\n\\nrepresentatives from Legal and Risk, that is responsible for the\\n\\noversight of reputational risk, including approval for business\\n\\nactivities that present elevated levels of reputational risks.\\n\\nClimate Risk Management\\n\\nClimate-related risks are divided into two major categories: (1)\\n\\nrisks related to the physical impacts of climate change, driven\\n\\nby extreme weather events such as hurricanes and floods, as\\n\\nwell as chronic longer-term shifts such as rising average global\\n\\ntemperatures and sea levels, and (2) risks related to the\\n\\ntransition to a low-carbon economy, which may entail extensive\\n\\npolicy, legal, technology and market changes. These changes\\n\\nand events may have broad impacts on operations, supply\\n\\nchains, distribution networks, customers and markets and are\\n\\notherwise referred to, respectively, as physical risk and\\n\\ntransition risk. These risks may impact both financial and\\n\\nnonfinancial risk types. Physical risk may lead to increased\\n\\ncredit risk by diminishing borrowers’ repayment capacity or\\n\\nimpacting the value of collateral. Physical risk may also increase\\n\\noperational risk by impacting the Corporation’s facilities,\\n\\nemployees, customers or vendors. Transition risks may amplify\\n\\ncredit risk through the financial impacts of changes in policy,\\n\\ntechnology or the market on the Corporation or its\\n\\ncounterparties. Unanticipated market changes can lead to\\n\\nsudden price adjustments and give rise to heightened market\\n\\nrisk. In addition, reputational risk may arise, including from our\\n\\nclimate-related practices and disclosures and if we do not meet\\n\\nour climate-related commitments.\\n\\nEffective management of climate risk requires coordinated\\n\\ngovernance, clearly defined roles and responsibilities and well-\\n\\ndeveloped processes to identify, measure, monitor and control\\n\\nrisks. As climate risk spans all key risk types, we have\\n\\ndeveloped and continue to enhance processes to embed\\n\\nclimate risk considerations into our Risk Framework and risk\\n\\nmanagement programs established for strategic, credit, market,\\n\\nliquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. Our\\n\\nEnvironmental and Social Risk Policy Framework aligns with our\\n\\nRisk Framework and provides additional clarity and transparency\\n\\nregarding our approach to environmental and social risks,\\n\\ninclusive of climate risk.\\n\\nOur governance framework establishes oversight of climate\\n\\nrisk practices and strategies by the Board, supported by its\\n\\nERC, as well as the MRC and the Responsible Growth\\n\\nCommittee, both of which are management-level committees\\n\\ncomprised of senior leaders across every major FLU and control\\n\\nfunction. The Responsible Growth Committee is supported by\\n\\nthe ESG Disclosure sub-committee, which is responsible for\\n\\nreviewing and providing oversight of the Corporation’s climate\\n\\nand ESG-related public disclosures.\\n\\nOur climate risk management efforts are overseen by an\\n\\nexecutive officer who reports to the CRO. The Climate Risk\\n\\nCouncil, which consists of leaders across risk, FLU and control\\n\\nfunctions, meets routinely to discuss our approach to managing\\n\\nclimate-related risks in line with our Risk Framework.\\n\\nIn 2021, we publicly announced our commitment to achieve\\n\\nnet zero emissions in our financing activities, operations, and\\n\\nsupply chain before 2050 (Net Zero Goal) and set 2030\\n\\nemissions targets for our operations and supply chain. In\\n\\nconnection with our Net Zero Goal, in 2022, we announced a\\n\\ntarget to reduce emissions by 2030 associated with our\\n\\nfinancing activities related to auto manufacturing, energy and\\n\\npower generation (2030 Targets). In our September 2022 Task\\n\\nForce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Report, we\\n\\ndisclosed our 2019 and 2020 financed emissions and\\n\\nemissions intensity metrics for these sectors, with 2019 serving\\n\\nas the baseline for our 2030 Targets.\\n\\nWe plan to disclose the financed emissions for additional\\n\\nportions of our business loan portfolio in 2023, and we plan to\\n\\nset financing activity emission reduction targets for other key\\n\\nsectors by April 2024.\\n\\nAchieving our climate--related goals and targets, including\\n\\nour Net Zero Goal and 2030 Targets, may require technological\\n\\nadvances, clearly defined roadmaps for industry sectors, new\\n\\nstandards and public policies, including those that improve the\\n\\ncost of capital for the transition to a low-carbon economy and\\n\\nbetter emissions data reporting, as well as ongoing, strong and\\n\\nactive engagement with customers, suppliers, investors,\\n\\ngovernment officials and other stakeholders.\\n\\nGiven the extended period of these and other climate-related\\n\\ngoals we have established, our initiatives have not resulted in a\\n\\nsignificant effect on our results of operations or financial\\n\\nposition in the relevant periods presented herein.\\n\\nFor more information about climate-related matters, including\\n\\nhow the Corporation manages climate risk, and the\\n\\nCorporation’s climate-related goals and commitments, including\\n\\nour plans to achieve our Net Zero Goal and 2030 Targets and\\n\\nprogress on our sustainable finance goals, see the\\n\\nCorporation’s website, including our 2022 Task Force on\\n\\nClimate-related Financial Disclosures Report and the 2022\\n\\nAnnual Report to shareholders available on the Investor\\n\\nRelations portion of our website in March 2023. The contents of\\n\\nthe Corporation’s website and 2022 Annual Report to\\n\\nshareholders are not incorporated by reference into this Annual\\n\\nReport on Form 10-K. For more information on climate-related\\n\\nrisks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2022 Annual Report on\\n\\nForm 10-K.\\n\\nThe foregoing discussion and our discussion in the 2022\\n\\nAnnual Report to shareholders regarding our goals and\\n\\ncommitments with respect to climate risk management,\\n\\nincluding environmental transition considerations, include\\n\\n“forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private\\n\\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are\\n\\nnot guarantees of future results or performance and involve\\n\\ncertain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and\\n\\nassumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond\\n\\nthe Corporation’s control. Actual outcomes and results may\\n\\ndiffer materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of\\n\\nthese forward-looking statements.\\n\\nComplex Accounting Estimates\\n\\nOur significant accounting principles, as described in Note 1 –\\n\\nSummary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated\\n\\nFinancial Statements, are essential in understanding the MD&A.\\n\\nMany of our significant accounting principles require complex\\n\\njudgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We\\n\\nhave procedures and processes in place to facilitate making\\n\\nthese judgments.\\n\\nThe more judgmental estimates are summarized in the\\n\\nfollowing discussion. We have identified and described the\\n\\ndevelopment of the variables most important in the estimation\\n\\nprocesses that involve mathematical models to derive the\\n\\nestimates. In many cases, there are numerous alternative\\n\\njudgments that could be used in the process of determining the\\n\\ninputs to the models. Where alternatives exist, we have used\\n\\nthe factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value\\n\\nin developing the inputs. Actual performance that differs from\\n\\nour estimates of the key variables could materially impact our\\n\\nresults of operations. Separate from the possible future impact\\n\\nto our results of operations from input and model variables, the\\n\\nvalue of our lending portfolio and market-sensitive assets and\\n\\nliabilities may change subsequent to the balance sheet date,\\n\\noften significantly, due to the nature and magnitude of future\\n\\ncredit and market conditions. Such credit and market conditions\\n\\nmay change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting\\n\\nvolatility could have a significant, negative effect on future\\n\\noperating results. These fluctuations would not be indicative of\\n\\ndeficiencies in our models or inputs.\\n\\nAllowance for Credit Losses\\n\\nThe allowance for credit losses includes the allowance for loan\\n\\nand lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending\\n\\ncommitments. Our process for determining the allowance for\\n\\ncredit losses is discussed in Note 1 – Summary of Significant\\n\\nAccounting Principles and Note 5 – Outstanding Loans and\\n\\nLeases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated\\n\\nFinancial Statements.\\n\\nThe determination of the allowance for credit losses is\\n\\nbased on numerous estimates and assumptions, which require\\n\\nBank of America 2022 129\\n\\na high degree of judgment and are often interrelated. A critical\\n\\njudgment in the process is the weighting of our forward-looking\\n\\nmacroeconomic scenarios that are incorporated into our\\n\\nquantitative models. As any one economic outlook is inherently\\n\\nuncertain, the Corporation uses multiple macroeconomic\\n\\nscenarios in its ECL calculation, which have included a baseline\\n\\nscenario derived from consensus estimates, an adverse\\n\\nscenario reflecting an extended moderate recession, a\\n\\ndownside scenario reflecting persistent inflation and interest\\n\\nrates above the baseline scenario, a tail risk scenario similar to\\n\\nthe severely adverse scenario used in stress testing and an\\n\\nupside scenario that considers the potential for improvement\\n\\nabove the baseline scenario. The overall economic outlook is\\n\\nweighted 95 percent towards a recessionary environment in\\n\\n2023, with continued inflationary pressures leading to lower\\n\\ngross domestic product (GDP) and higher unemployment rate\\n\\nexpectations as compared to the prior year. Generally, as the\\n\\nconsensus estimates improve or deteriorate, the allowance for\\n\\ncredit losses will change in a similar direction. There are\\n\\nmultiple variables that drive the macroeconomic scenarios with\\n\\nthe key variables including, but not limited to, U.S. GDP and\\n\\nunemployment rates. As of December 31, 2021, the weighted\\n\\nmacroeconomic outlook for the U.S. average unemployment rate\\n\\nwas forecasted at 5.2 percent, 4.7 percent and 4.3 percent in\\n\\nthe fourth quarters of 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively, and\\n\\nthe weighted macroeconomic outlook for U.S. GDP was\\n\\nforecasted to grow at 2.1 percent, 1.9 percent and 1.9 percent\\n\\nyear-over-year in the fourth quarters of 2022, 2023 and 2024,\\n\\nrespectively. As of December 31, 2022, the latest consensus\\n\\nestimates for the U.S. average unemployment rate for the fourth\\n\\nquarter of 2022 was 3.7 percent and U.S. GDP was forecasted\\n\\nto grow 0.4 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2022,\\n\\nreflecting a tighter labor market and depressed growth\\n\\nexpectations compared to our macroeconomic outlook as of\\n\\nDecember 31, 2021, and were factored into our allowance for\\n\\ncredit losses estimate as of December 31, 2022. In addition,\\n\\nas of December 31, 2022, the weighted macroeconomic\\n\\noutlook for the U.S. average unemployment rate was forecasted\\n\\nat 5.6 percent and 5.0 percent in the fourth quarters of 2023\\n\\nand 2024, and the weighted macroeconomic outlook for U.S.\\n\\nGDP was forecasted to contract 0.4 percent and grow 1.2\\n\\npercent year-over-year in the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2024.\\n\\nIn addition to the above judgments and estimates, the\\n\\nallowance for credit losses can also be impacted by\\n\\nunanticipated changes in asset quality of the portfolio, such as\\n\\nincreases or decreases in credit and/or internal risk ratings in\\n\\nour commercial portfolio, improvement or deterioration in\\n\\nborrower delinquencies or credit scores in our credit card\\n\\nportfolio and increases or decreases in home prices, which is a\\n\\nprimary driver of LTVs, in our consumer real estate portfolio, all\\n\\nof which have some degree of uncertainty. The allowance for\\n\\ncredit losses increased to $14.2 billion from $13.8 billion at\\n\\nDecember 31, 2021, primarily due to loan growth and a\\n\\ndampened macroeconomic outlook in 2022.\\n\\nTo provide an illustration of the sensitivity of the\\n\\nmacroeconomic scenarios and other assumptions on the\\n\\nestimate of our allowance for credit losses, the Corporation\\n\\ncompared the December 31, 2022 modeled ECL from the\\n\\nbaseline scenario and our adverse scenario. Relative to the\\n\\nbaseline scenario, the adverse scenario assumed a peak U.S.\\n\\nunemployment rate of nearly three percentage points higher\\n\\nthan the baseline scenario, a decline in U.S. GDP followed by a\\n\\nprolonged recovery and a lower home price outlook with a\\n\\ndifference of approximately eight percent at the trough. This\\n\\n130 Bank of America 2022\\n\\nsensitivity analysis resulted in a hypothetical increase in the\\n\\nallowance for credit losses of approximately $4 billion.\\n\\nWhile the sensitivity analysis may be useful to understand\\n\\nhow changes in macroeconomic assumptions could impact our\\n\\nmodeled ECLs, it is not meant to forecast how our allowance for\\n\\ncredit losses is expected to change in a different\\n\\nmacroeconomic outlook. Importantly, the analysis does not\\n\\nincorporate a variety of factors, including qualitative reserves\\n\\nand the weighting of alternate scenarios, which could have\\n\\noffsetting effects on the estimate. Considering the variety of\\n\\nfactors contemplated when developing and weighting\\n\\nmacroeconomic outlooks such as recent economic events,\\n\\nleading economic indicators, views of internal and third-party\\n\\neconomists and industry trends, in addition to other qualitative\\n\\nfactors, the Corporation believes the allowance for credit losses\\n\\nat December 31, 2022 is appropriate.\\n\\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\\n\\nUnder applicable accounting standards, we are required to\\n\\nmaximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of\\n\\nunobservable inputs in measuring fair value. We classify fair\\n\\nvalue measurements of financial instruments and MSRs based\\n\\non the three-level fair value hierarchy in the accounting\\n\\nstandards.\\n\\nThe fair values of assets and liabilities may include\\n\\nadjustments, such as market liquidity and credit quality, where\\n\\nappropriate. Valuations of products using models or other\\n\\ntechniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant\\n\\ninputs. Where market data is available, the inputs used for\\n\\nvaluation reflect that information as of our valuation date. Inputs\\n\\nto valuation models are considered unobservable if they are\\n\\nsupported by little or no market activity. In periods of extreme\\n\\nvolatility, lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets, there may be\\n\\nmore variability in market pricing or a lack of market data to use\\n\\nin the valuation process. In keeping with the prudent application\\n\\nof estimates and management judgment in determining the fair\\n\\nvalue of assets and liabilities, we have in place various\\n\\nprocesses and controls that include: a model validation policy\\n\\nthat requires review and approval of quantitative models used\\n\\nfor deal pricing, financial statement fair value determination and\\n\\nrisk quantification; a trading product valuation policy that\\n\\nrequires verification of all traded product valuations; and a\\n\\nperiodic review and substantiation of daily profit and loss\\n\\nreporting for all traded products. Primarily through validation\\n\\ncontrols, we utilize both broker and pricing service inputs which\\n\\ncan and do include both market-observable and internallymodeled values and/or valuation inputs. Our reliance on this\\n\\ninformation is affected by our understanding of how the broker\\n\\nand/or pricing service develops its data with a higher degree of\\n\\nreliance applied to those that are more directly observable and\\n\\nlesser reliance applied to those developed through their own\\n\\ninternal modeling. For example, broker quotes in less active\\n\\nmarkets may only be indicative and therefore less reliable.\\n\\nThese processes and controls are performed independently of\\n\\nthe business. For more information, see Note 20 – Fair Value\\n\\nMeasurements and Note 21 – Fair Value Option to the\\n\\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\\n\\nLevel 3 Assets and Liabilities\\n\\nFinancial assets and liabilities, and MSRs, where values are\\n\\nbased on valuation techniques that require inputs that are both\\n\\nunobservable and are significant to the overall fair value\\n\\nmeasurement are classified as Level 3 under the fair value\\n\\nhierarchy established in applicable accounting standards. The\\n\\nfair value of these Level 3 financial assets and liabilities and\\n\\nMSRs is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow\\n\\nmethodologies or similar techniques for which the determination\\n\\nof fair value requires significant management judgment or\\n\\nestimation.\\n\\nLevel 3 financial instruments may be hedged with derivatives\\n\\nclassified as Level 1 or 2; therefore, gains or losses associated\\n\\nwith Level 3 financial instruments may be offset by gains or\\n\\nlosses associated with financial instruments classified in other\\n\\nlevels of the fair value hierarchy. The Level 3 gains and losses\\n\\nrecorded in earnings did not have a significant impact on our\\n\\nliquidity or capital. We conduct a review of our fair value\\n\\nhierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or\\n\\nout of Level 3 are made if the significant inputs used in the\\n\\nfinancial models measuring the fair values of the assets and\\n\\nliabilities became unobservable or observable, respectively, in\\n\\nthe current marketplace. For more information on transfers into\\n\\nand out of Level 3 during 2022, 2021 and 2020, see Note 20 –\\n\\nFair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial\\n\\nStatements.\\n\\nAccrued Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets\\n\\nAccrued income taxes, reported as a component of either other\\n\\nassets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the\\n\\nConsolidated Balance Sheet, represent the net amount of\\n\\ncurrent income taxes we expect to pay to or receive from various\\n\\ntaxing jurisdictions attributable to our operations to date. We\\n\\ncurrently file income tax returns in more than 100 jurisdictions\\n\\nand consider many factors, including statutory, judicial and\\n\\nregulatory guidance, in estimating the appropriate accrued\\n\\nincome taxes for each jurisdiction.\\n\\nNet deferred tax assets, reported as a component of other\\n\\nassets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, represent the net\\n\\ndecrease in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of\\n\\nnet operating loss (NOL) and tax credit carryforwards and\\n\\nbecause of future reversals of temporary differences in the\\n\\nbases of assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and\\n\\ntheir bases as reported in the financial statements. NOL and tax\\n\\ncredit carryforwards result in reductions to future tax liabilities,\\n\\nand many of these attributes can expire if not utilized within\\n\\ncertain periods. We consider the need for valuation allowances\\n\\nto reduce net deferred tax assets to the amounts that we\\n\\nestimate are more likely than not to be realized.\\n\\nConsistent with the applicable accounting guidance, we\\n\\nmonitor relevant tax authorities and change our estimates of\\n\\naccrued income taxes and/or net deferred tax assets due to\\n\\nchanges in income tax laws and their interpretation by the\\n\\ncourts and regulatory authorities. These revisions of our\\n\\nestimates, which also may result from our income tax planning\\n\\nand from the resolution of income tax audit matters, may be\\n\\nmaterial to our operating results for any given period.\\n\\nSee Note 19 – Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial\\n\\nStatements for a table of significant tax attributes and\\n\\nadditional information.

Also in our opinion,\\n\\nthe Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective\\n\\ninternal control over financial reporting as of December 31,\\n\\n2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\\n\\nChange in Accounting Principle\\n\\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial\\n\\nstatements, the Corporation changed the manner in which it\\n\\naccounts for credit losses on certain financial instruments in\\n\\n2020.\\n\\nBasis for Opinions\\n\\nThe Corporation’s management is responsible for these\\n\\nconsolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\\n\\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment\\n\\nof the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,\\n\\nincluded in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal\\n\\nControl Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express\\n\\nopinions on the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements\\n\\nand on the Corporation\\'s internal control over financial reporting\\n\\nbased on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered\\n\\nwith the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\\n\\nStates) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with\\n\\nrespect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal\\n\\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\\n\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\n\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards\\n\\nof the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\\n\\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about\\n\\nwhether the consolidated financial statements are free of\\n\\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and\\n\\nwhether effective internal control over financial reporting was\\n\\nmaintained in all material respects. Our audits of the\\n\\nconsolidated financial statements included performing\\n\\nprocedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the\\n\\nconsolidated financial statements, whether due to error or\\n\\nfraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.\\n\\nSuch procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\\n\\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated\\n\\nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the\\n\\naccounting principles used and significant estimates made by\\n\\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of\\n\\nthe consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal\\n\\ncontrol over financial reporting included obtaining an\\n\\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting,\\n\\nassessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing\\n\\nand evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of\\n\\ninternal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also\\n\\nincluded performing such other procedures as we considered\\n\\nnecessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits\\n\\nprovide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\\n\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over\\n\\nFinancial Reporting\\n\\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a\\n\\nprocess designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding\\n\\nthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\\n\\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with\\n\\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal\\n\\ncontrol over financial reporting includes those policies and\\n\\nprocedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in\\n\\nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions\\n\\nand dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide\\n\\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as\\n\\nnecessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\\n\\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and\\n\\nthat receipts and expenditures of the company are being made\\n\\nonly in accordance with authorizations of management and\\n\\ndirectors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance\\n\\nregarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized\\n\\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that\\n\\ncould have a material effect on the financial statements.\\n\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over\\n\\nfinancial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\\n\\nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future\\n\\nperiods are subject to the risk that controls may become\\n\\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the\\n\\ndegree of compliance with the policies or procedures may\\n\\ndeteriorate.\\n\\nCritical Audit Matters\\n\\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters\\n\\narising from the current period audit of the consolidated\\n\\nfinancial statements that were communicated or required to be\\n\\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to\\n\\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated\\n\\nfinancial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging,\\n\\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical\\n\\naudit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the\\n\\nconsolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we\\n\\nare not, by communicating the critical audit matters below,\\n\\nproviding separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on\\n\\nthe accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\\n\\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses - Commercial and\\n\\nConsumer Card Loans\\n\\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial\\n\\nstatements, the allowance for loan and lease losses represents\\n\\nmanagement’s estimate of the expected credit losses in the\\n\\nBank of America 2022 135\\n\\nCorporation’s loan and lease portfolio, excluding loans and\\n\\nunfunded lending commitments accounted for under the fair\\n\\nvalue option. As of December 31, 2022, the allowance for loan\\n\\nand lease losses was $12.7 billion on total loans and leases of\\n\\n$1,040.0 billion, which excludes loans accounted for under the\\n\\nfair value option. For commercial and consumer card loans, the\\n\\nexpected credit loss is typically estimated using quantitative\\n\\nmethods that consider a variety of factors such as historical\\n\\nloss experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio as well\\n\\nas an economic outlook over the life of the loan. In its loss\\n\\nforecasting framework, the Corporation incorporates forward\\n\\nlooking information through the use of macroeconomic\\n\\nscenarios applied over the forecasted life of the assets. These\\n\\nmacroeconomic scenarios include variables that have\\n\\nhistorically been key drivers of increases and decreases in\\n\\ncredit losses. These variables include, but are not limited to,\\n\\nunemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product\\n\\nlevels and corporate bond spreads. The scenarios that are\\n\\nchosen and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a\\n\\nvariety of factors including recent economic events, leading\\n\\neconomic indicators, views of internal as well as third-party\\n\\neconomists and industry trends. Also included in the allowance\\n\\nfor loan and lease losses are qualitative reserves to cover\\n\\nlosses that are expected but, in the Corporation\\'s assessment,\\n\\nmay not be adequately reflected in the quantitative methods or\\n\\nthe economic assumptions. Factors that the Corporation\\n\\nconsiders include changes in lending policies and procedures,\\n\\nbusiness conditions, the nature and size of the portfolio,\\n\\nportfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due\\n\\nloans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such\\n\\nas competition, and legal and regulatory requirements, among\\n\\nothers. Further, the Corporation considers the inherent\\n\\nuncertainty in quantitative models that are built on historical\\n\\ndata.\\n\\nThe principal considerations for our determination that\\n\\nperforming procedures relating to the allowance for loan and\\n\\nlease losses for the commercial and consumer card portfolios is\\n\\na critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and\\n\\nestimation by management in developing lifetime economic\\n\\nforecast scenarios, related weightings to each scenario and\\n\\ncertain qualitative reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of\\n\\nauditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing\\n\\nprocedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained, and (ii)\\n\\nthe audit effort involved professionals with specialized skill and\\n\\nknowledge.\\n\\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and\\n\\nevaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall\\n\\nopinion on the consolidated financial statements. These\\n\\nprocedures included testing the effectiveness of controls\\n\\nrelating to the allowance for loan and lease losses, including\\n\\ncontrols over the evaluation and approval of models, forecast\\n\\nscenarios and related weightings, and qualitative reserves.\\n\\nThese procedures also included, among others, testing\\n\\nmanagement’s process for estimating the allowance for loan\\n\\nand lease losses, including (i) evaluating the appropriateness of\\n\\nthe loss forecast models and methodology, (ii) evaluating the\\n\\nreasonableness of certain macroeconomic variables, (iii)\\n\\nevaluating the reasonableness of management’s development,\\n\\nselection and weighting of lifetime economic forecast scenarios\\n\\nused in the loss forecast models, (iv) testing the completeness\\n\\nand accuracy of data used in the estimate, and (v) evaluating\\n\\nthe reasonableness of certain qualitative reserves made to the\\n\\n136 Bank of America 2022\\n\\nmodel output results to determine the overall allowance for loan\\n\\nand lease losses. The procedures also included the involvement\\n\\nof professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist\\n\\nin evaluating the appropriateness of certain loss forecast\\n\\nmodels, the reasonableness of economic forecast scenarios\\n\\nand related weightings and the reasonableness of certain\\n\\nqualitative reserves.\\n\\nValuation of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments\\n\\nAs described in Notes 1 and 20 to the consolidated financial\\n\\nstatements, the Corporation carries certain financial\\n\\ninstruments at fair value, which includes $10.7 billion of assets\\n\\nand $7.1 billion of liabilities classified as Level 3 fair value\\n\\nmeasurements that are valued on a recurring basis and $3.4\\n\\nbillion of assets classified as Level 3 fair value measurements\\n\\nthat are valued on a nonrecurring basis, for which the\\n\\ndetermination of fair value requires significant management\\n\\njudgment or estimation. The Corporation determines the fair\\n\\nvalue of Level 3 financial instruments using pricing models,\\n\\ndiscounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques that\\n\\nrequire inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to\\n\\nthe overall fair value measurement. Unobservable inputs, such\\n\\nas volatility or implied yield, may be determined using\\n\\nquantitative-based extrapolations, pricing models or other\\n\\ninternal methodologies which incorporate management\\n\\nestimates and available market information.\\n\\nThe principal considerations for our determination that\\n\\nperforming procedures relating to the valuation of certain Level\\n\\n3 financial instruments is a critical audit matter are the\\n\\nsignificant judgment and estimation used by management to\\n\\ndetermine the fair value of these financial instruments, which in\\n\\nturn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and\\n\\neffort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence\\n\\nobtained, including the involvement of professionals with\\n\\nspecialized skill and knowledge.\\n\\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and\\n\\nevaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall\\n\\nopinion on the consolidated financial statements. These\\n\\nprocedures included testing the effectiveness of controls\\n\\nrelating to the valuation of financial instruments, including\\n\\ncontrols related to valuation models, significant unobservable\\n\\ninputs, and data. These procedures also included, among\\n\\nothers, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill\\n\\nand knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate\\n\\nof fair value for a sample of these certain financial instruments\\n\\nand comparison of management’s estimate to the\\n\\nindependently developed estimate of fair value. Developing the\\n\\nindependent estimate involved testing the completeness and\\n\\naccuracy of data provided by management and evaluating the\\n\\nreasonableness of management’s significant unobservable\\n\\ninputs.\\n\\nCharlotte, North Carolina\\n\\nFebruary 22, 2023\\n\\nWe have served as the Corporation’s auditor since 1958.\\n\\nBank of America Corporation and

of America Corporation and Subsidiaries\\n\\nSignificant Accounting Principles\\n\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\nCash and Cash Equivalents\\n\\nNOTE 1 Summary of Significant Accounting\\n\\nPrinciples\\n\\nBank of America Corporation, a bank holding company and a\\n\\nfinancial holding company, provides a diverse range of financial\\n\\nservices and products throughout the U.S. and in certain\\n\\ninternational markets. The term “the Corporation” as used\\n\\nherein may refer to Bank of America Corporation, individually,\\n\\nBank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of\\n\\nBank of America Corporation’s subsidiaries or affiliates.\\n\\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash items in\\n\\nthe process of collection, cash segregated under federal and\\n\\nother brokerage regulations, and amounts due from\\n\\ncorrespondent banks, the Federal Reserve Bank and certain\\n\\nnon-U.S. central banks. Certain cash balances are restricted as\\n\\nto withdrawal or usage by legally binding contractual agreements\\n\\nor regulatory requirements.\\n\\nSecurities Financing Agreements\\n\\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of\\n\\nthe Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries and those\\n\\nvariable interest entities (VIEs) where the Corporation is the\\n\\nprimary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions\\n\\nhave been eliminated. Results of operations of acquired\\n\\ncompanies are included from the dates of acquisition, and for\\n\\nVIEs, from the dates that the Corporation became the primary\\n\\nbeneficiary. Assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity are\\n\\nnot included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The\\n\\nCorporation accounts for investments in companies for which it\\n\\nowns a voting interest and for which it has the ability to exercise\\n\\nsignificant influence over operating and financing decisions\\n\\nusing the equity method of accounting. These investments,\\n\\nwhich include the Corporation’s interests in affordable housing\\n\\nand renewable energy partnerships, are recorded in other\\n\\nassets. Equity method investments are subject to impairment\\n\\ntesting, and the Corporation’s proportionate share of income or\\n\\nloss is included in other income.\\n\\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in\\n\\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the\\n\\nUnited States of America requires management to make\\n\\nestimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and\\n\\ndisclosures. Actual results could materially differ from those\\n\\nestimates and assumptions. Certain prior-period amounts have\\n\\nbeen reclassified to conform to current period presentation.\\n\\nSecurities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell\\n\\nand securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase\\n\\n(securities financing agreements) are treated as collateralized\\n\\nfinancing transactions except in instances where the transaction\\n\\nis required to be accounted for as individual sale and purchase\\n\\ntransactions. Generally, these agreements are recorded at\\n\\nacquisition or sale price plus accrued interest. In instances\\n\\nwhere the interest is negative, the Corporation’s policy is to\\n\\npresent negative interest on financial assets as interest income\\n\\nand negative interest on financial liabilities as interest expense.\\n\\nFor securities financing agreements that are accounted for\\n\\nunder the fair value option, the changes in the fair value of\\n\\nthese securities financing agreements are recorded in market\\n\\nmaking and similar activities in the Consolidated Statement of\\n\\nIncome.\\n\\nThe Corporation’s policy is to monitor the market value of\\n\\nthe principal amount loaned under resale agreements and\\n\\nobtain collateral from or return collateral pledged to\\n\\ncounterparties\\n\\nwhen\\n\\nappropriate.\\n\\nSecurities\\n\\nfinancing\\n\\nagreements do not create material credit risk due to these\\n\\ncollateral provisions; therefore, an allowance for loan losses is\\n\\nnot necessary.\\n\\nIn transactions where the Corporation acts as the lender in a\\n\\nsecurities lending agreement and receives securities that can\\n\\nbe pledged or sold as collateral, it recognizes an asset on the\\n\\nConsolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, representing the\\n\\nsecurities received, and a liability, representing the obligation to\\n\\nreturn those securities.\\n\\nNew Accounting Standards\\n\\nTrading Instruments\\n\\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation\\n\\nHedge Accounting\\n\\nThe FASB issued a new accounting standard that makes\\n\\ntargeted improvements to the application of the fair value hedge\\n\\naccounting guidance for closed portfolios of financial assets.\\n\\nThe targeted improvements were effective January 1, 2023 on a\\n\\nprospective basis.\\n\\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Losses\\n\\nThe FASB amended the accounting and disclosure requirements\\n\\nfor expected credit losses (ECL) by removing the recognition and\\n\\nmeasurement guidance on troubled debt restructurings (TDRs)\\n\\nand adding disclosures on the financial effect and subsequent\\n\\nperformance of certain types of modifications made to\\n\\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulties. The effects of these\\n\\nchanges on the Corporation’s consolidated financial position,\\n\\nresults of operations or disclosures in the Notes to the\\n\\nConsolidated Financial Statements are not significant. The\\n\\namendments were effective on January 1, 2023, which the\\n\\nCorporation adopted using a modified retrospective approach.\\n\\nFinancial instruments utilized in trading activities are carried at\\n\\nfair value. Fair value is generally based on quoted market prices\\n\\nfor the same or similar assets and liabilities. If these market\\n\\nprices are not available, fair values are estimated based on\\n\\ndealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow\\n\\nmethodologies, or similar techniques where the determination\\n\\nof fair value may require significant management judgment or\\n\\nestimation. Realized gains and losses are recorded on a tradedate basis. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are\\n\\nrecognized in market making and similar activities.\\n\\nDerivatives and Hedging Activities\\n\\nDerivatives are entered into on behalf of customers, for trading\\n\\nor to support risk management activities. Derivatives used in\\n\\nrisk management activities include derivatives that are both\\n\\ndesignated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships and\\n\\nderivatives used to hedge market risks in relationships that are\\n\\nnot designated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships\\n\\n(referred to as other risk management activities). The\\n\\nCorporation manages interest rate and foreign currency\\n\\nexchange rate sensitivity predominantly through the use of\\n\\nderivatives. Derivatives utilized by the Corporation include\\n\\nswaps, futures and forward settlement contracts, and option\\n\\ncontracts.\\n\\nBank of America 2022 141\\n\\nAll derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance\\n\\nSheet at fair value, taking into consideration the effects of\\n\\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements that allow the\\n\\nCorporation to settle positive and negative positions and offset\\n\\ncash collateral held with the same counterparty on a net basis.\\n\\nFor exchange-traded contracts, fair value is based on quoted\\n\\nmarket prices in active or inactive markets or is derived from\\n\\nobservable market-based pricing parameters, similar to those\\n\\napplied to over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. For non-exchange\\n\\ntraded contracts, fair value is based on dealer quotes, pricing\\n\\nmodels, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar\\n\\ntechniques for which the determination of fair value may require\\n\\nsignificant management judgment or estimation.\\n\\nValuations of derivative assets and liabilities reflect the\\n\\nvalue of the instrument including counterparty credit risk. These\\n\\nvalues also take into account the Corporation’s own credit\\n\\nstanding.\\n\\nTrading Derivatives and Other Risk Management Activities\\n\\nDerivatives held for trading purposes are included in derivative\\n\\nassets or derivative liabilities on the Consolidated Balance\\n\\nSheet with changes in fair value included in market making and\\n\\nsimilar activities.\\n\\nDerivatives used for other risk management activities are\\n\\nincluded in derivative assets or derivative liabilities. Derivatives\\n\\nused in other risk management activities have not been\\n\\ndesignated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships because\\n\\nthey did not qualify or the risk that is being mitigated pertains to\\n\\nan item that is reported at fair value through earnings so that\\n\\nthe effect of measuring the derivative instrument and the asset\\n\\nor liability to which the risk exposure pertains will offset in the\\n\\nConsolidated Statement of Income to the extent effective. The\\n\\nchanges in the fair value of derivatives that serve to mitigate\\n\\ncertain risks associated with mortgage servicing rights (MSRs),\\n\\ninterest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and first-lien mortgage\\n\\nloans held-for-sale (LHFS) that are originated by the Corporation\\n\\nare recorded in other income. Changes in the fair value of\\n\\nderivatives that serve to mitigate interest rate risk and foreign\\n\\ncurrency risk are included in market making and similar\\n\\nactivities. Credit derivatives are also used by the Corporation to\\n\\nmitigate the risk associated with various credit exposures. The\\n\\nchanges in the fair value of these derivatives are included in\\n\\nmarket making and similar activities and other income.\\n\\nDerivatives Used For Hedge Accounting Purposes\\n\\n(Accounting Hedges)\\n\\nFor accounting hedges, the Corporation formally documents at\\n\\ninception all relationships between hedging instruments and\\n\\nhedged items, as well as the risk management objectives and\\n\\nstrategies for undertaking various accounting hedges.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Corporation primarily uses regression analysis\\n\\nat the inception of a hedge and for each reporting period\\n\\nthereafter to assess whether the derivative used in an\\n\\naccounting hedge transaction is expected to be and has been\\n\\nhighly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash\\n\\nflows of a hedged item or forecasted transaction. The\\n\\nCorporation discontinues hedge accounting when it is\\n\\ndetermined that a derivative is not expected to be or has\\n\\nceased to be highly effective as a hedge, and then reflects\\n\\nchanges in fair value of the derivative in earnings after\\n\\ntermination of the hedge relationship.\\n\\nFair value hedges are used to protect against changes in the\\n\\nfair value of the Corporation’s assets and liabilities that are\\n\\nattributable to interest rate or foreign exchange volatility.\\n\\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value\\n\\n142 Bank of America 2022\\n\\nhedges are recorded in earnings, together and in the same\\n\\nincome statement line item with changes in the fair value of the\\n\\nrelated hedged item. If a derivative instrument in a fair value\\n\\nhedge is terminated or the hedge designation removed, the\\n\\nprevious adjustments to the carrying value of the hedged asset\\n\\nor liability are subsequently accounted for in the same manner\\n\\nas other components of the carrying value of that asset or\\n\\nliability. For interest-earning assets and interest-bearing\\n\\nliabilities, such adjustments are amortized to earnings over the\\n\\nremaining life of the respective asset or liability.\\n\\nCash flow hedges are used primarily to minimize the\\n\\nvariability in cash flows of assets and liabilities or forecasted\\n\\ntransactions caused by interest rate or foreign exchange rate\\n\\nfluctuations. The Corporation also uses cash flow hedges to\\n\\nhedge the price risk associated with deferred compensation.\\n\\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives used in cash flow\\n\\nhedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive\\n\\nincome (OCI) and are reclassified into the line item in the\\n\\nincome statement in which the hedged item is recorded in the\\n\\nsame period the hedged item affects earnings. Components of\\n\\na derivative that are excluded in assessing hedge effectiveness\\n\\nare recorded in the same income statement line item as the\\n\\nhedged item.\\n\\nNet investment hedges are used to manage the foreign\\n\\nexchange rate sensitivity arising from a net investment in a\\n\\nforeign operation. Changes in the spot prices of derivatives that\\n\\nare designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations\\n\\nare recorded as a component of accumulated OCI. The\\n\\nremaining components of these derivatives are excluded in\\n\\nassessing hedge effectiveness and are recorded in market\\n\\nmaking and similar activities.\\n\\nSecurities\\n\\nDebt securities are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet\\n\\nat their trade date. Their classification is dependent on the\\n\\npurpose for which the securities were acquired. Debt securities\\n\\npurchased for use in the Corporation’s trading activities are\\n\\nreported in trading account assets at fair value with unrealized\\n\\ngains and losses included in market making and similar\\n\\nactivities. Substantially all other debt securities purchased are\\n\\nused in the Corporation’s asset and liability management (ALM)\\n\\nactivities and are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet\\n\\nas either debt securities carried at fair value or as held-tomaturity (HTM) debt securities. Debt securities carried at fair\\n\\nvalue are either available-for-sale (AFS) securities with\\n\\nunrealized gains and losses net-of-tax included in accumulated\\n\\nOCI or carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses\\n\\nreported in market making and similar activities. HTM debt\\n\\nsecurities are debt securities that management has the intent\\n\\nand ability to hold to maturity and are reported at amortized\\n\\ncost.\\n\\nThe Corporation evaluates each AFS security where the value\\n\\nhas declined below amortized cost. If the Corporation intends to\\n\\nsell or believes it is more likely than not that it will be required\\n\\nto sell the debt security, it is written down to fair value through\\n\\nearnings. For AFS debt securities the Corporation intends to\\n\\nhold, the Corporation evaluates the debt securities for ECL,\\n\\nexcept for debt securities that are guaranteed by the U.S.\\n\\nTreasury, U.S. government agencies or sovereign entities of high\\n\\ncredit quality where the Corporation applies a zero credit loss\\n\\nassumption. For the remaining AFS debt securities, the\\n\\nCorporation considers qualitative parameters such as internal\\n\\nand external credit ratings and the value of underlying collateral.\\n\\nIf an AFS debt security fails any of the qualitative parameters, a\\n\\ndiscounted cash flow analysis is used by the Corporation to\\n\\ndetermine if a portion of the unrealized loss is a result of an\\n\\nECL. The Corporation will then recognize either credit loss\\n\\nexpense or a reversal of credit loss expense in other income for\\n\\nthe amount necessary to adjust the debt securities valuation\\n\\nallowance to its current estimate of expected credit losses.\\n\\nCash flows expected to be collected are estimated using all\\n\\nrelevant information available such as remaining payment\\n\\nterms, prepayment speeds, the financial condition of the issuer,\\n\\nexpected defaults and the value of the underlying collateral. If\\n\\nany of the decline in fair value is related to market factors, that\\n\\namount is recognized in accumulated OCI. In certain instances,\\n\\nthe credit loss may exceed the total decline in fair value, in\\n\\nwhich case, the allowance recorded is limited to the difference\\n\\nbetween the amortized cost and the fair value of the asset.\\n\\nThe Corporation separately evaluates its HTM debt securities\\n\\nfor any credit losses, of which substantially all qualify for the\\n\\nzero loss assumption. For the remaining securities, the\\n\\nCorporation performs a discounted cash flow analysis to\\n\\nestimate any credit losses which are then recognized as part of\\n\\nthe allowance for credit losses.\\n\\nInterest on debt securities, including amortization of\\n\\npremiums and accretion of discounts, is included in interest\\n\\nincome. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted to\\n\\ninterest income at a constant effective yield over the contractual\\n\\nlives of the securities. Realized gains and losses from the sales\\n\\nof debt securities are determined using the specific\\n\\nidentification method.\\n\\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values that\\n\\nare not held for trading purposes are carried at fair value with\\n\\nunrealized gains and losses included in other income. Equity\\n\\nsecurities that do not have readily determinable fair values are\\n\\nrecorded at cost less impairment, if any, plus or minus\\n\\nqualifying observable price changes. These securities are\\n\\nreported in other assets.\\n\\nLoans and Leases\\n\\nLoans, with the exception of loans accounted for under the fair\\n\\nvalue option, are measured at historical cost and reported at\\n\\ntheir outstanding principal balances net of any unearned\\n\\nincome, charge-offs, unamortized deferred fees and costs on\\n\\noriginated loans, and for purchased loans, net of any\\n\\nunamortized premiums or discounts. Loan origination fees and\\n\\ncertain direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as\\n\\nadjustments to interest income over the lives of the related\\n\\nloans. Unearned income, discounts and premiums are\\n\\namortized to interest income using a level yield methodology.\\n\\nThe Corporation elects to account for certain consumer and\\n\\ncommercial loans under the fair value option with interest\\n\\nreported in interest income and changes in fair value reported in\\n\\nmarket making and similar activities or other income.\\n\\nUnder applicable accounting guidance, for reporting\\n\\npurposes, the loan and lease portfolio is categorized by portfolio\\n\\nsegment and, within each portfolio segment, by class of\\n\\nfinancing receivable. A portfolio segment is defined as the level\\n\\nat which an entity develops and documents a systematic\\n\\nmethodology to determine the allowance for credit losses, and a\\n\\nclass of financing receivable is defined as the level of\\n\\ndisaggregation of portfolio segments based on the initial\\n\\nmeasurement attribute, risk characteristics and methods for\\n\\nassessing risk. The Corporation’s three portfolio segments are\\n\\nConsumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and\\n\\nCommercial. The classes within the Consumer Real Estate\\n\\nportfolio segment are residential mortgage and home equity.\\n\\nThe classes within the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio\\n\\nsegment are credit card, direct/indirect consumer and other\\n\\nconsumer. The classes within the Commercial portfolio segment\\n\\nare U.S. commercial, non-U.S. commercial, commercial real\\n\\nestate, commercial lease financing and U.S. small business\\n\\ncommercial.\\n\\nLeases\\n\\nThe Corporation provides equipment financing to its customers\\n\\nthrough a variety of lessor arrangements. Direct financing\\n\\nleases and sales-type leases are carried at the aggregate of\\n\\nlease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of\\n\\nthe leased property less unearned income, which is accreted to\\n\\ninterest income over the lease terms using methods that\\n\\napproximate the interest method. Operating lease income is\\n\\nrecognized on a straight-line basis. The Corporation\\'s lease\\n\\narrangements generally do not contain non-lease components.\\n\\nAllowance for Credit Losses\\n\\nOn January 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted the new\\n\\naccounting standard that requires the measurement of the\\n\\nallowance for credit losses, which includes both the allowance\\n\\nfor loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending\\n\\ncommitments, to be based on management’s best estimate of\\n\\nthe ECL in the Corporation’s loan and lease portfolio, excluding\\n\\nloans and unfunded lending commitments accounted for under\\n\\nthe fair value option. Upon adoption, a $3.3 billion, or 32\\n\\npercent, increase in the allowance for credit losses was\\n\\nrecorded on January 1, 2020, which was comprised of a net\\n\\nincrease of $2.9 billion in the allowance for loan and lease\\n\\nlosses and a $310 million increase in the reserve for unfunded\\n\\nlending commitments. The ECL on funded consumer and\\n\\ncommercial loans and leases is referred to as the allowance for\\n\\nloan and lease losses and is reported separately as a contraasset to loans and leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\\n\\nThe ECL for unfunded lending commitments, including home\\n\\nequity lines of credit (HELOCs), standby letters of credit (SBLCs)\\n\\nand binding unfunded loan commitments is reported on the\\n\\nConsolidated Balance Sheet in accrued expenses and other\\n\\nliabilities. The provision for credit losses related to the loan and\\n\\nlease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments is reported\\n\\nin the Consolidated Statement of Income at the amount\\n\\nnecessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the\\n\\ncurrent estimate of ECL.\\n\\nFor loans and leases, the ECL is typically estimated using\\n\\nquantitative methods that consider a variety of factors such as\\n\\nhistorical loss experience, the current credit quality of the\\n\\nportfolio as well as an economic outlook over the life of the\\n\\nloan. The life of the loan for closed-ended products is based on\\n\\nthe contractual maturity of the loan adjusted for any expected\\n\\nprepayments. The contractual maturity includes any extension\\n\\noptions that are at the sole discretion of the borrower. For openended products (e.g., lines of credit), the ECL is determined\\n\\nbased on the maximum repayment term associated with future\\n\\ndraws from credit lines unless those lines of credit are\\n\\nunconditionally cancellable (e.g., credit cards) in which case the\\n\\nCorporation does not record any allowance.\\n\\nIn its loss forecasting framework, the Corporation\\n\\nincorporates forward-looking information through the use of\\n\\nmacroeconomic scenarios applied over the forecasted life of the\\n\\nassets. These macroeconomic scenarios include variables that\\n\\nhave historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in\\n\\ncredit losses. These variables include, but are not limited to,\\n\\nunemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product\\n\\nlevels and corporate bond spreads. As any one economic\\n\\noutlook is inherently uncertain, the Corporation leverages\\n\\nmultiple scenarios. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter\\n\\nBank of America 2022 143\\n\\nand the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of\\n\\nfactors including recent economic events, leading economic\\n\\nindicators, views of internal and third-party economists and\\n\\nindustry trends.\\n\\nThe estimate of credit losses includes expected recoveries\\n\\nof amounts previously charged off (i.e., negative allowance). If a\\n\\nloan has been charged off, the expected cash flows on the loan\\n\\nare not limited by the current amortized cost balance. Instead,\\n\\nexpected cash flows can be assumed up to the unpaid principal\\n\\nbalance immediately prior to the charge-off.\\n\\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses for TDRs is\\n\\nmeasured based on the present value of projected future\\n\\nlifetime principal and interest cash flows discounted at the\\n\\nloan’s original effective interest rate, or in cases where\\n\\nforeclosure is probable or the loan is collateral dependent, at\\n\\nthe loan’s collateral value or its observable market price, if\\n\\navailable. The measurement of ECL for the renegotiated\\n\\nconsumer credit card TDR portfolio is based on the present\\n\\nvalue of projected cash flows discounted using the average TDR\\n\\nportfolio contractual interest rate, excluding promotionally priced\\n\\nloans, in effect prior to restructuring. Projected cash flows for\\n\\nTDRs use the same economic outlook as discussed above. For\\n\\npurposes of computing this specific loss component of the\\n\\nallowance, larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and\\n\\nsmaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool.\\n\\nAlso included in the allowance for loan and lease losses are\\n\\nqualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the\\n\\nCorporation\\'s assessment, may not be adequately reflected in\\n\\nthe quantitative methods or the economic assumptions\\n\\ndescribed above. For example, factors that the Corporation\\n\\nconsiders include changes in lending policies and procedures,\\n\\nbusiness conditions, the nature and size of the portfolio,\\n\\nportfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due\\n\\nloans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such\\n\\nas competition, and legal and regulatory requirements, among\\n\\nothers. Further, the Corporation considers the inherent\\n\\nuncertainty in quantitative models that are built on historical\\n\\ndata.\\n\\nWith the exception of the Corporation\\'s credit card portfolio,\\n\\nthe Corporation does not include reserves for interest receivable\\n\\nin the measurement of the allowance for credit losses as the\\n\\nCorporation generally classifies consumer loans as\\n\\nnonperforming at 90 days past due and reverses interest\\n\\nincome for these loans at that time. For credit card loans, the\\n\\nCorporation reserves for interest and fees as part of the\\n\\nallowance for loan and lease losses. Upon charge-off of a credit\\n\\ncard loan, the Corporation reverses the interest and fee income\\n\\nagainst the income statement line item where it was originally\\n\\nrecorded.\\n\\nThe Corporation has identified the following three portfolio\\n\\nsegments and measures the allowance for credit losses using\\n\\nthe following methods.\\n\\nConsumer Real Estate\\n\\nTo estimate ECL for consumer loans secured by residential real\\n\\nestate, the Corporation estimates the number of loans that will\\n\\ndefault over the life of the existing portfolio, after factoring in\\n\\nestimated\\n\\nprepayments,\\n\\nusing\\n\\nquantitative\\n\\nmodeling\\n\\nmethodologies. The attributes that are most significant in\\n\\nestimating the Corporation’s ECL include refreshed loan-to-value\\n\\n(LTV) or, in the case of a subordinated lien, refreshed combined\\n\\nLTV (CLTV), borrower credit score, months since origination and\\n\\ngeography, all of which are further broken down by present\\n\\ncollection status (whether the loan is current, delinquent, in\\n\\ndefault, or in bankruptcy). The estimates are based on the\\n\\n144 Bank of America 2022\\n\\nCorporation’s historical experience with the loan portfolio,\\n\\nadjusted to reflect the economic outlook. The outlook on the\\n\\nunemployment rate and consumer real estate prices are key\\n\\nfactors that impact the frequency and severity of loss estimates.\\n\\nThe Corporation does not reserve for credit losses on the\\n\\nunpaid principal balance of loans insured by the Federal\\n\\nHousing Administration (FHA) and long-term standby loans, as\\n\\nthese loans are fully insured. The Corporation records a reserve\\n\\nfor unfunded lending commitments for the ECL associated with\\n\\nthe undrawn portion of the Corporation’s HELOCs, which can\\n\\nonly be canceled by the Corporation if certain criteria are met.\\n\\nThe ECL associated with these unfunded lending commitments\\n\\nis calculated using the same models and methodologies noted\\n\\nabove and incorporate utilization assumptions at time of\\n\\ndefault.\\n\\nFor loans that are more than 180 days past due and\\n\\ncollateral-dependent TDRs, the Corporation bases the allowance\\n\\non the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral as of the\\n\\nreporting date less costs to sell. The fair value of the collateral\\n\\nsecuring these loans is generally determined using an\\n\\nautomated valuation model (AVM) that estimates the value of a\\n\\nproperty by reference to market data including sales of\\n\\ncomparable properties and price trends specific to the\\n\\nMetropolitan Statistical Area in which the property being valued\\n\\nis located. In the event that an AVM value is not available, the\\n\\nCorporation utilizes publicized indices or if these methods\\n\\nprovide less reliable valuations, the Corporation uses appraisals\\n\\nor broker price opinions to estimate the fair value of the\\n\\ncollateral. While there is inherent imprecision in these\\n\\nvaluations, the Corporation believes that they are representative\\n\\nof this portfolio in the aggregate.\\n\\nFor loans that are more than 180 days past due and\\n\\ncollateral-dependent TDRs, with the exception of the\\n\\nCorporation’s fully insured portfolio, the outstanding balance of\\n\\nloans that is in excess of the estimated property value after\\n\\nadjusting for costs to sell is charged off. If the estimated\\n\\nproperty value decreases in periods subsequent to the initial\\n\\ncharge-off, the Corporation will record an additional charge-off;\\n\\nhowever, if the value increases in periods subsequent to the\\n\\ncharge-off, the Corporation will adjust the allowance to account\\n\\nfor the increase but not to a level above the cumulative chargeoff amount.\\n\\nCredit Cards and Other Consumer\\n\\nCredit cards are revolving lines of credit without a defined\\n\\nmaturity date. The estimated life of a credit card receivable is\\n\\ndetermined by estimating the amount and timing of expected\\n\\nfuture payments (e.g., borrowers making full payments,\\n\\nminimum payments or somewhere in between) that it will take\\n\\nfor a receivable balance to pay off. The ECL on the future\\n\\npayments incorporates the spending behavior of a borrower\\n\\nthrough time using key borrower-specific factors and the\\n\\neconomic outlook described above. The Corporation applies all\\n\\nexpected payments in accordance with the Credit Card\\n\\nAccountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (i.e.,\\n\\npaying down the highest interest rate bucket first). Then\\n\\nforecasted future payments are prioritized to pay off the oldest\\n\\nbalance until it is brought to zero or an expected charge-off\\n\\namount. Unemployment rate outlook, borrower credit score,\\n\\ndelinquency status and historical payment behavior are all key\\n\\ninputs into the credit card receivable loss forecasting model.\\n\\nFuture draws on the credit card lines are excluded from the ECL\\n\\nas they are unconditionally cancellable.\\n\\nThe ECL for the consumer vehicle lending portfolio is also\\n\\ndetermined using quantitative methods supplemented with\\n\\nqualitative analysis. The quantitative model estimates ECL\\n\\ngiving consideration to key borrower and loan characteristics\\n\\nsuch as delinquency status, borrower credit score, LTV ratio,\\n\\nunderlying collateral type and collateral value.\\n\\nCommercial\\n\\nThe ECL on commercial loans is forecasted using models that\\n\\nestimate credit losses over the loan’s contractual life at an\\n\\nindividual loan level. The models use the contractual terms to\\n\\nforecast future principal cash flows while also considering\\n\\nexpected prepayments. For open-ended commitments such as\\n\\nrevolving lines of credit, changes in funded balance are captured\\n\\nby forecasting a borrower’s draw and payment behavior over the\\n\\nremaining life of the commitment. For loans collateralized with\\n\\ncommercial real estate and for which the underlying asset is the\\n\\nprimary source of repayment, the loss forecasting models\\n\\nconsider key loan and customer attributes such as LTV ratio,\\n\\nnet operating income and debt service coverage, and captures\\n\\nvariations in behavior according to property type and region. The\\n\\noutlook on the unemployment rate, gross domestic product, and\\n\\nforecasted real estate prices are utilized to determine indicators\\n\\nsuch as rent levels and vacancy rates, which impact the ECL\\n\\nestimate. For all other commercial loans and leases, the loss\\n\\nforecasting model determines the probabilities of transition to\\n\\ndifferent credit risk ratings or default at each point over the life\\n\\nof the asset based on the borrower’s current credit risk rating,\\n\\nindustry sector, size of the exposure and the geographic market.\\n\\nThe severity of loss is determined based on the type of\\n\\ncollateral securing the exposure, the size of the exposure, the\\n\\nborrower’s industry sector, any guarantors and the geographic\\n\\nmarket. Assumptions of expected loss are conditioned to the\\n\\neconomic outlook, and the model considers key economic\\n\\nvariables such as unemployment rate, gross domestic product,\\n\\ncorporate bond spreads, real estate and other asset prices and\\n\\nequity market returns.\\n\\nIn addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, the\\n\\nCorporation also estimates ECL related to unfunded lending\\n\\ncommitments such as letters of credit, financial guarantees,\\n\\nunfunded bankers acceptances and binding loan commitments,\\n\\nexcluding commitments accounted for under the fair value\\n\\noption. Reserves are estimated for the unfunded exposure using\\n\\nthe same models and methodologies as the funded exposure\\n\\nand are reported as reserves for unfunded lending\\n\\ncommitments.\\n\\nNonperforming Loans and Leases, Charge-offs and\\n\\nDelinquencies\\n\\nNonperforming loans and leases generally include loans and\\n\\nleases that have been placed on nonaccrual status. Loans\\n\\naccounted for under the fair value option and LHFS are not\\n\\nreported as nonperforming. When a nonaccrual loan is deemed\\n\\nuncollectible, it is charged off against the allowance for credit\\n\\nlosses. If the charged-off amount is later recovered, the amount\\n\\nis reversed through the allowance for credit losses at the\\n\\nrecovery date. Charge-offs are reported net of recoveries (net\\n\\ncharge-offs). If recoveries for the period are greater than chargeoffs, net charge-offs are reported as a negative amount.\\n\\nIn accordance with the Corporation’s policies, consumer real\\n\\nestate-secured loans, including residential mortgages and home\\n\\nequity loans, are generally placed on nonaccrual status and\\n\\nclassified as nonperforming at 90 days past due unless\\n\\nrepayment of the loan is insured by the FHA or through\\n\\nindividually insured long-term standby agreements with Fannie\\n\\nMae (FNMA) or Freddie Mac (FHLMC) (the fully-insured portfolio).\\n\\nResidential mortgage loans in the fully-insured portfolio are not\\n\\nplaced on nonaccrual status and, therefore, are not reported as\\n\\nnonperforming. Junior-lien home equity loans are placed on\\n\\nnonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming when the\\n\\nunderlying first-lien mortgage loan becomes 90 days past due\\n\\neven if the junior-lien loan is current. The outstanding balance of\\n\\nreal estate-secured loans that is in excess of the estimated\\n\\nproperty value less costs to sell is charged off no later than the\\n\\nend of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due\\n\\nunless the loan is fully insured, or for loans in bankruptcy, within\\n\\n60 days of receipt of notification of filing, with the remaining\\n\\nbalance classified as nonperforming.\\n\\nCredit card and other unsecured consumer loans are\\n\\ncharged off when the loan becomes 180 days past due, within\\n\\n60 days after receipt of notification of death or bankruptcy or\\n\\nupon confirmation of fraud. These loans continue to accrue\\n\\ninterest until they are charged off and, therefore, are not\\n\\nreported as nonperforming loans. Consumer vehicle loans are\\n\\nplaced on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days past\\n\\ndue, within 60 days after receipt of notification of bankruptcy or\\n\\ndeath or upon confirmation of fraud. These loans are charged\\n\\noff to their collateral values when the loans become 120 days\\n\\npast due, upon repossession of the collateral, within 60 days\\n\\nafter receipt of notification of bankruptcy or death or upon\\n\\nconfirmation of fraud. If repossession of the collateral is not\\n\\nexpected, the loans are fully charged off.\\n\\nCommercial loans and leases, excluding business card\\n\\nloans, that are past due 90 days or more as to principal or\\n\\ninterest, or where reasonable doubt exists as to timely\\n\\ncollection, including loans that are individually identified as\\n\\nbeing impaired, are generally placed on nonaccrual status and\\n\\nclassified as nonperforming unless well-secured and in the\\n\\nprocess of collection.\\n\\nBusiness card loans are charged off in the same manner as\\n\\nconsumer credit card loans. Other commercial loans and leases\\n\\nare generally charged off when all or a portion of the principal\\n\\namount is determined to be uncollectible.\\n\\nThe entire balance of a consumer loan or commercial loan or\\n\\nlease is contractually delinquent if the minimum payment is not\\n\\nreceived by the specified due date on the customer’s billing\\n\\nstatement. Interest and fees continue to accrue on past due\\n\\nloans and leases until the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual\\n\\nstatus, if applicable. Accrued interest receivable is reversed\\n\\nwhen loans and leases are placed on nonaccrual status.\\n\\nInterest collections on nonaccruing loans and leases for which\\n\\nthe ultimate collectability of principal is uncertain are applied as\\n\\nprincipal reductions; otherwise, such collections are credited to\\n\\nincome when received. Loans and leases may be restored to\\n\\naccrual status when all principal and interest is current and full\\n\\nrepayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is\\n\\nexpected.\\n\\nTroubled Debt Restructurings\\n\\nConsumer and commercial loans and leases whose contractual\\n\\nterms have been restructured in a manner that grants a\\n\\nconcession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties are\\n\\nclassified as TDRs. Concessions could include a reduction in\\n\\nthe interest rate to a rate that is below market on the loan,\\n\\npayment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or\\n\\nother actions designed to maximize collections. Loans that are\\n\\ncarried at fair value and LHFS are not classified as TDRs.\\n\\nLoans and leases whose contractual terms have been\\n\\nmodified in a TDR and are current at the time of restructuring\\n\\nmay remain on accrual status if there is demonstrated\\n\\nperformance prior to the restructuring and payment in full under\\n\\nthe restructured terms is expected. Otherwise, the loans are\\n\\nBank of America 2022 145\\n\\nplaced on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming,\\n\\nexcept for fully-insured consumer real estate loans, until there is\\n\\nsustained repayment performance for a reasonable period,\\n\\ngenerally six months. If accruing TDRs cease to perform in\\n\\naccordance with their modified contractual terms, they are\\n\\nplaced on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming\\n\\nTDRs.\\n\\nSecured consumer loans that have been discharged in\\n\\nChapter 7 bankruptcy and have not been reaffirmed by the\\n\\nborrower are classified as TDRs at the time of discharge. Such\\n\\nloans are placed on nonaccrual status and written down to the\\n\\nestimated collateral value less costs to sell no later than at the\\n\\ntime of discharge. If these loans are contractually current,\\n\\ninterest collections are generally recorded in interest income on\\n\\na cash basis. Consumer real estate-secured loans for which a\\n\\nbinding offer to restructure has been extended are also\\n\\nclassified as TDRs. Credit card and other unsecured consumer\\n\\nloans that have been renegotiated in a TDR generally remain on\\n\\naccrual status until the loan is either paid in full or charged off,\\n\\nwhich occurs no later than the end of the month in which the\\n\\nloan becomes 180 days past due or, for loans that have been\\n\\nplaced on a fixed payment plan, 120 days past due.\\n\\nA loan that had previously been modified in a TDR and is\\n\\nsubsequently refinanced under current underwriting standards at\\n\\na market rate with no concessionary terms is accounted for as a\\n\\nnew loan and is no longer reported as a TDR.\\n\\nLoans Held-for-sale\\n\\nLoans that the Corporation intends to sell in the foreseeable\\n\\nfuture, including residential mortgages, loan syndications, and\\n\\nto a lesser degree, commercial real estate, consumer finance\\n\\nand other loans, are reported as LHFS and are carried at the\\n\\nlower of aggregate cost or fair value. The Corporation accounts\\n\\nfor certain LHFS, including residential mortgage LHFS, under the\\n\\nfair value option. Loan origination costs for LHFS carried at the\\n\\nlower of cost or fair value are capitalized as part of the carrying\\n\\nvalue of the loans and, upon the sale of a loan, are recognized\\n\\nas part of the gain or loss in noninterest income. LHFS that are\\n\\non nonaccrual status and are reported as nonperforming, as\\n\\ndefined in the policy herein, are reported separately from\\n\\nnonperforming loans and leases.\\n\\nPremises and Equipment\\n\\nPremises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated\\n\\ndepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization\\n\\nare recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated\\n\\nuseful lives of the assets. Estimated lives range up to 40 years\\n\\nfor buildings, up to 12 years for furniture and equipment, and\\n\\nthe shorter of lease term or estimated useful life for leasehold\\n\\nimprovements.\\n\\nOther Assets\\n\\nFor the Corporation’s financial assets that are measured at\\n\\namortized cost and are not included in debt securities or loans\\n\\nand leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Corporation\\n\\nevaluates these assets for ECL using various techniques. For\\n\\nassets that are subject to collateral maintenance provisions,\\n\\nincluding federal funds sold and securities borrowed or\\n\\npurchased under agreements to resell, where the collateral\\n\\nconsists of daily margining of liquid and marketable assets\\n\\nwhere the margining is expected to be maintained into the\\n\\nforeseeable future, the expected losses are assumed to be\\n\\nzero. For all other assets, the Corporation performs qualitative\\n\\nanalyses, including consideration of historical losses and\\n\\ncurrent economic conditions, to estimate any ECL which are\\n\\n146 Bank of America 2022\\n\\nthen included in a valuation account that is recorded as a\\n\\ncontra-asset against the amortized cost basis of the financial\\n\\nasset.\\n\\nLessee Arrangements\\n\\nSubstantially all of the Corporation’s lessee arrangements are\\n\\noperating leases. Under these arrangements, the Corporation\\n\\nrecords right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at lease\\n\\ncommencement. Right-of-use assets are reported in other\\n\\nassets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the related\\n\\nlease liabilities are reported in accrued expenses and other\\n\\nliabilities. All leases are recorded on the Consolidated Balance\\n\\nSheet except leases with an initial term less than 12 months for\\n\\nwhich the Corporation made the short-term lease election.\\n\\nLease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the\\n\\nlease term and is recorded in occupancy and equipment\\n\\nexpense in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\\n\\nThe Corporation made an accounting policy election not to\\n\\nseparate lease and non-lease components of a contract that is\\n\\nor contains a lease for its real estate and equipment leases. As\\n\\nsuch, lease payments represent payments on both lease and\\n\\nnon-lease components. At lease commencement, lease\\n\\nliabilities are recognized based on the present value of the\\n\\nremaining lease payments and discounted using the\\n\\nCorporation’s incremental borrowing rate. Right-of-use assets\\n\\ninitially equal the lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments\\n\\nmade prior to lease commencement and for any lease\\n\\nincentives.\\n\\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\\n\\nGoodwill is the purchase premium after adjusting for the fair\\n\\nvalue of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is\\n\\nreviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis, or when\\n\\nevents or circumstances indicate a potential impairment, at the\\n\\nreporting unit level. A reporting unit is a business segment or\\n\\none level below a business segment.\\n\\nThe Corporation assesses the fair value of each reporting\\n\\nunit against its carrying value, including goodwill, as measured\\n\\nby allocated equity. For purposes of goodwill impairment testing,\\n\\nthe Corporation utilizes allocated equity as a proxy for the\\n\\ncarrying value of its reporting units. Allocated equity in the\\n\\nreporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for\\n\\nthe portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to\\n\\nthe reporting unit.\\n\\nIn performing its goodwill impairment testing, the\\n\\nCorporation first assesses qualitative factors to determine\\n\\nwhether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a\\n\\nreporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors\\n\\ninclude, among other things, macroeconomic conditions,\\n\\nindustry and market considerations, financial performance of\\n\\nthe respective reporting unit and other relevant entity- and\\n\\nreporting-unit specific considerations.\\n\\nIf the Corporation concludes it is more likely than not that\\n\\nthe fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a\\n\\nquantitative assessment is performed. The Corporation has an\\n\\nunconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for\\n\\nany reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to\\n\\nperforming the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The\\n\\nCorporation may resume performing the qualitative assessment\\n\\nin any subsequent period.\\n\\nWhen performing the quantitative assessment, if the fair\\n\\nvalue of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of\\n\\nthe reporting unit would not be considered impaired. If the\\n\\ncarrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a\\n\\ngoodwill impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by\\n\\nwhich the reporting unit’s allocated equity exceeds its fair value.\\n\\nAn impairment loss recognized cannot exceed the amount of\\n\\ngoodwill assigned to a reporting unit. An impairment loss\\n\\nestablishes a new basis in the goodwill, and subsequent\\n\\nreversals of goodwill impairment losses are not permitted under\\n\\napplicable accounting guidance.\\n\\nFor intangible assets subject to amortization, an impairment\\n\\nloss is recognized if the carrying value of the intangible asset is\\n\\nnot recoverable and exceeds fair value. The carrying value of the\\n\\nintangible asset is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the\\n\\nsum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the\\n\\nuse of the asset. Intangible assets deemed to have indefinite\\n\\nuseful lives are not subject to amortization. An impairment loss\\n\\nis recognized if the carrying value of the intangible asset with an\\n\\nindefinite life exceeds its fair value.\\n\\nVariable Interest Entities\\n\\nA VIE is an entity that lacks equity investors or whose equity\\n\\ninvestors do not have a controlling financial interest in the entity\\n\\nthrough their equity investments. The Corporation consolidates\\n\\na VIE if it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE\\n\\nthat most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance\\n\\nand an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive\\n\\nbenefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. On a\\n\\nquarterly basis, the Corporation reassesses its involvement with\\n\\nthe VIE and evaluates the impact of changes in governing\\n\\ndocuments and its financial interests in the VIE. The\\n\\nconsolidation status of the VIEs with which the Corporation is\\n\\ninvolved may change as a result of such reassessments.\\n\\nThe Corporation primarily uses VIEs for its securitization\\n\\nactivities, in which the Corporation transfers whole loans or debt\\n\\nsecurities into a trust or other vehicle. When the Corporation is\\n\\nthe servicer of whole loans held in a securitization trust,\\n\\nincluding non-agency residential mortgages, home equity loans,\\n\\ncredit cards, and other loans, the Corporation has the power to\\n\\ndirect the most significant activities of the trust. The Corporation\\n\\ngenerally does not have the power to direct the most significant\\n\\nactivities of a residential mortgage agency trust except in certain\\n\\ncircumstances in which the Corporation holds substantially all of\\n\\nthe issued securities and has the unilateral right to liquidate the\\n\\ntrust. The power to direct the most significant activities of a\\n\\ncommercial mortgage securitization trust is typically held by the\\n\\nspecial servicer or by the party holding specific subordinate\\n\\nsecurities which embody certain controlling rights. The\\n\\nCorporation consolidates a whole-loan securitization trust if it\\n\\nhas the power to direct the most significant activities and also\\n\\nholds securities issued by the trust or has other contractual\\n\\narrangements, other than standard representations and\\n\\nwarranties, that could potentially be significant to the trust.\\n\\nThe Corporation may also transfer trading account securities\\n\\nand AFS securities into municipal bond or resecuritization\\n\\ntrusts. The Corporation consolidates a municipal bond or\\n\\nresecuritization trust if it has control over the ongoing activities\\n\\nof the trust such as the remarketing of the trust’s liabilities or, if\\n\\nthere are no ongoing activities, sole discretion over the design\\n\\nof the trust, including the identification of securities to be\\n\\ntransferred in and the structure of securities to be issued, and\\n\\nalso retains securities or has liquidity or other commitments\\n\\nthat could potentially be significant to the trust. The Corporation\\n\\ndoes not consolidate a municipal bond or resecuritization trust if\\n\\none or a limited number of third-party investors share\\n\\nresponsibility for the design of the trust or have control over the\\n\\nsignificant activities of the trust through liquidation or other\\n\\nsubstantive rights.\\n\\nOther VIEs used by the Corporation include collateralized\\n\\ndebt obligations (CDOs), investment vehicles created on behalf\\n\\nof customers and other investment vehicles. The Corporation\\n\\ndoes not routinely serve as collateral manager for CDOs and,\\n\\ntherefore, does not typically have the power to direct the\\n\\nactivities that most significantly impact the economic\\n\\nperformance of a CDO. However, following an event of default, if\\n\\nthe Corporation is a majority holder of senior securities issued\\n\\nby a CDO and acquires the power to manage its assets, the\\n\\nCorporation consolidates the CDO.\\n\\nThe Corporation consolidates a customer or other\\n\\ninvestment vehicle if it has control over the initial design of the\\n\\nvehicle or manages the assets in the vehicle and also absorbs\\n\\npotentially significant gains or losses through an investment in\\n\\nthe vehicle, derivative contracts or other arrangements. The\\n\\nCorporation does not consolidate an investment vehicle if a\\n\\nsingle investor controlled the initial design of the vehicle or\\n\\nmanages the assets in the vehicles or if the Corporation does\\n\\nnot have a variable interest that could potentially be significant\\n\\nto the vehicle.\\n\\nRetained interests in securitized assets are initially recorded\\n\\nat fair value. In addition, the Corporation may invest in debt\\n\\nsecurities issued by unconsolidated VIEs. Fair values of these\\n\\ndebt securities, which are classified as trading account assets,\\n\\ndebt securities carried at fair value or HTM securities, are based\\n\\nprimarily on quoted market prices in active or inactive markets.\\n\\nGenerally, quoted market prices for retained residual interests\\n\\nare not available; therefore, the Corporation estimates fair\\n\\nvalues based on the present value of the associated expected\\n\\nfuture cash flows.\\n\\nFair Value\\n\\nThe Corporation measures the fair values of its assets and\\n\\nliabilities, where applicable, in accordance with accounting\\n\\nguidance that requires an entity to base fair value on exit price.\\n\\nUnder this guidance, an entity is required to maximize the use\\n\\nof observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable\\n\\ninputs in measuring fair value. Under applicable accounting\\n\\nstandards, fair value measurements are categorized into one of\\n\\nthree levels based on the inputs to the valuation technique with\\n\\nthe highest priority given to unadjusted quoted prices in active\\n\\nmarkets and the lowest priority given to unobservable inputs.\\n\\nThe Corporation categorizes its fair value measurements of\\n\\nfinancial instruments based on this three-level hierarchy.\\n\\nLevel 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for\\n\\nidentical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and\\n\\nliabilities include debt and equity securities and\\n\\nderivative contracts that are traded in an active\\n\\nexchange market, as well as certain U.S. Treasury\\n\\nsecurities that are highly liquid and are actively traded\\n\\nin OTC markets.\\n\\nLevel 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as\\n\\nquoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted\\n\\nprices in markets that are not active, or other inputs\\n\\nthat are observable or can be corroborated by\\n\\nobservable market data for substantially the full term\\n\\nof the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and\\n\\nliabilities include debt securities with quoted prices\\n\\nthat are traded less frequently than exchange-traded\\n\\ninstruments and derivative contracts where fair value is\\n\\ndetermined using a pricing model with inputs that are\\n\\nobservable in the market or can be derived principally\\n\\nfrom or corroborated by observable market data. This\\n\\ncategory generally includes U.S. government and\\n\\nBank of America 2022 147\\n\\nagency mortgage-backed (MBS) and asset-backed\\n\\nsecurities (ABS), corporate debt securities, derivative\\n\\ncontracts, certain loans and LHFS.\\n\\nLevel 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no\\n\\nmarket activity and that are significant to the overall\\n\\nfair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets\\n\\nand liabilities include financial instruments for which\\n\\nthe determination of fair value requires significant\\n\\nmanagement judgment or estimation. The fair value for\\n\\nsuch assets and liabilities is generally determined\\n\\nusing pricing models, discounted cash flow\\n\\nmethodologies or similar techniques that incorporate\\n\\nthe assumptions a market participant would use in\\n\\npricing the asset or liability. This category generally\\n\\nincludes retained residual interests in securitizations,\\n\\nconsumer MSRs, certain ABS, highly structured,\\n\\ncomplex or long-dated derivative contracts, certain\\n\\nloans and LHFS, IRLCs and certain CDOs where\\n\\nindependent pricing information cannot be obtained for\\n\\na significant portion of the underlying assets.\\n\\nIncome Taxes\\n\\nThere are two components of income tax expense: current and\\n\\ndeferred. Current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid\\n\\nor refunded for the current period. Deferred income tax expense\\n\\nresults from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities\\n\\nbetween periods. These gross deferred tax assets and liabilities\\n\\nrepresent decreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid\\n\\nin the future because of future reversals of temporary\\n\\ndifferences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured\\n\\nby tax laws and their bases as reported in the financial\\n\\nstatements. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for tax\\n\\nattributes such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax\\n\\ncredit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are recorded to\\n\\nreduce deferred tax assets to the amounts management\\n\\nconcludes are more likely than not to be realized.\\n\\nIncome tax benefits are recognized and measured based\\n\\nupon a two-step model: first, a tax position must be more likely\\n\\nthan not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits in\\n\\norder to be recognized, and second, the benefit is measured as\\n\\nthe largest dollar amount of that position that is more likely than\\n\\nnot to be sustained upon settlement. The difference between\\n\\nthe benefit recognized and the tax benefit claimed on a tax\\n\\nreturn is referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit. The\\n\\nCorporation records income tax-related interest and penalties, if\\n\\napplicable, within income tax expense.\\n\\nRevenue Recognition\\n\\nThe following summarizes the Corporation’s revenue recognition\\n\\naccounting policies for certain noninterest income activities.\\n\\nCard Income\\n\\nCard income includes annual, late and over-limit fees as well as\\n\\ninterchange, cash advances and other miscellaneous items\\n\\nfrom credit and debit card transactions and from processing\\n\\ncard transactions for merchants. Card income is presented net\\n\\nof direct costs. Interchange fees are recognized upon\\n\\nsettlement of the credit and debit card payment transactions\\n\\nand are generally determined on a percentage basis for credit\\n\\ncards and fixed rates for debit cards based on the\\n\\ncorresponding payment network’s rates. Substantially all card\\n\\nfees are recognized at the transaction date, except for certain\\n\\ntime-based fees such as annual fees, which are recognized over\\n\\n12 months. Fees charged to cardholders and merchants that\\n\\nare estimated to be uncollectible are reserved in the allowance\\n\\n148 Bank of America 2022\\n\\nfor loan and lease losses. Included in direct cost are rewards\\n\\nand credit card partner payments. Rewards paid to cardholders\\n\\nare related to points earned by the cardholder that can be\\n\\nredeemed for a broad range of rewards including cash, travel\\n\\nand gift cards. The points to be redeemed are estimated based\\n\\non past redemption behavior, card product type, account\\n\\ntransaction activity and other historical card performance. The\\n\\nliability is reduced as the points are redeemed. The Corporation\\n\\nalso makes payments to credit card partners. The payments are\\n\\nbased on revenue-sharing agreements that are generally driven\\n\\nby cardholder transactions and partner sales volumes. As part\\n\\nof the revenue-sharing agreements, the credit card partner\\n\\nprovides the Corporation exclusive rights to market to the credit\\n\\ncard partner’s members or customers on behalf of the\\n\\nCorporation.\\n\\nService Charges\\n\\nService charges include deposit and lending-related fees.\\n\\nDeposit-related fees consist of fees earned on consumer and\\n\\ncommercial deposit activities and are generally recognized when\\n\\nthe transactions occur or as the service is performed. Consumer\\n\\nfees are earned on consumer deposit accounts for account\\n\\nmaintenance and various transaction-based services, such as\\n\\nATM transactions, wire transfer activities, check and money\\n\\norder processing and insufficient funds/overdraft transactions.\\n\\nCommercial deposit-related fees are from the Corporation’s\\n\\nGlobal Transaction Services business and consist of commercial\\n\\ndeposit and treasury management services, including account\\n\\nmaintenance and other services, such as payroll, sweep\\n\\naccount and other cash management services. Lending-related\\n\\nfees generally represent transactional fees earned from certain\\n\\nloan commitments, financial guarantees and SBLCs.\\n\\nInvestment and Brokerage Services\\n\\nInvestment and brokerage services consist of asset\\n\\nmanagement and brokerage fees. Asset management fees are\\n\\nearned from the management of client assets under advisory\\n\\nagreements or the full discretion of the Corporation’s financial\\n\\nadvisors (collectively referred to as assets under management\\n\\n(AUM)). Asset management fees are earned as a percentage of\\n\\nthe client’s AUM and generally range from 50 basis points (bps)\\n\\nto 150 bps of the AUM. In cases where a third party is used to\\n\\nobtain a client’s investment allocation, the fee remitted to the\\n\\nthird party is recorded net and is not reflected in the transaction\\n\\nprice, as the Corporation is an agent for those services.\\n\\nBrokerage fees include income earned from transactionbased services that are performed as part of investment\\n\\nmanagement services and are based on a fixed price per unit or\\n\\nas a percentage of the total transaction amount. Brokerage fees\\n\\nalso include distribution fees and sales commissions that are\\n\\nprimarily in the Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM)\\n\\nsegment and are earned over time. In addition, primarily in the\\n\\nGlobal Markets segment, brokerage fees are earned when the\\n\\nCorporation fills customer orders to buy or sell various financial\\n\\nproducts or when it acknowledges, affirms, settles and clears\\n\\ntransactions and/or submits trade information to the\\n\\nappropriate clearing broker. Certain customers pay brokerage,\\n\\nclearing and/or exchange fees imposed by relevant regulatory\\n\\nbodies or exchanges in order to execute or clear trades. These\\n\\nfees are recorded net and are not reflected in the transaction\\n\\nprice, as the Corporation is an agent for those services.\\n\\nInvestment Banking Income\\n\\nInvestment banking income includes underwriting income and\\n\\nfinancial advisory services income. Underwriting consists of fees\\n\\nearned for the placement of a customer’s debt or equity\\n\\nsecurities. The revenue is generally earned based on a\\n\\npercentage of the fixed number of shares or principal placed.\\n\\nOnce the number of shares or notes is determined and the\\n\\nservice is completed, the underwriting fees are recognized. The\\n\\nCorporation incurs certain out-of-pocket expenses, such as legal\\n\\ncosts, in performing these services. These expenses are\\n\\nrecovered through the revenue the Corporation earns from the\\n\\ncustomer and are included in operating expenses. Syndication\\n\\nfees represent fees earned as the agent or lead lender\\n\\nresponsible for structuring, arranging and administering a loan\\n\\nsyndication.\\n\\nFinancial advisory services consist of fees earned for\\n\\nassisting clients with transactions related to mergers and\\n\\nacquisitions and financial restructurings. Revenue varies\\n\\ndepending on the size of the transaction and scope of services\\n\\nperformed and is generally contingent on successful completion\\n\\nof the transaction. Revenue is typically recognized once the\\n\\ntransaction is completed and all services have been rendered.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Corporation may earn a fixed fee in merger and\\n\\nacquisition transactions to provide a fairness opinion, with the\\n\\nfees recognized when the opinion is delivered to the client.\\n\\nOther Revenue Measurement and Recognition Policies\\n\\nThe Corporation did not disclose the value of any open\\n\\nperformance obligations at December 31, 2022, as its\\n\\ncontracts with customers generally have a fixed term that is less\\n\\nthan one year, an open term with a cancellation period that is\\n\\nless than one year, or provisions that allow the Corporation to\\n\\nrecognize revenue at the amount it has the right to invoice.\\n\\ncommon shares subject to repurchase or cancellation. Net\\n\\nincome allocated to common shareholders is net income\\n\\nadjusted for preferred stock dividends including dividends\\n\\ndeclared, accretion of discounts on preferred stock including\\n\\naccelerated accretion when preferred stock is repaid early, and\\n\\ncumulative dividends related to the current dividend period that\\n\\nhave not been declared as of period end, less income allocated\\n\\nto participating securities. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing\\n\\nincome allocated to common shareholders plus dividends on\\n\\ndilutive convertible preferred stock and preferred stock that can\\n\\nbe tendered to exercise warrants, by the weighted-average\\n\\ncommon shares outstanding plus amounts representing the\\n\\ndilutive effect of stock options outstanding, restricted stock,\\n\\nrestricted stock units (RSUs), outstanding warrants and the\\n\\ndilution resulting from the conversion of convertible preferred\\n\\nstock, if applicable.\\n\\nForeign Currency Translation\\n\\nAssets, liabilities and operations of foreign branches and\\n\\nsubsidiaries are recorded based on the functional currency of\\n\\neach entity. When the functional currency of a foreign operation\\n\\nis the local currency, the assets, liabilities and operations are\\n\\ntranslated, for consolidation purposes, from the local currency\\n\\nto the U.S. dollar reporting currency at period-end rates for\\n\\nassets and liabilities and generally at average rates for results\\n\\nof operations. The resulting unrealized gains and losses are\\n\\nreported as a component of accumulated OCI, net-of-tax. When\\n\\nthe foreign entity’s functional currency is the U.S. dollar, the\\n\\nresulting remeasurement gains or losses on foreign currencydenominated assets or liabilities are included in earnings.\\n\\nEarnings Per Common Share\\n\\nEarnings per common share (EPS) is computed by dividing net\\n\\nincome allocated to common shareholders by the weightedaverage common shares outstanding, excluding unvested\\n\\nBank of America 2022 149\\n\\nNOTE 2 Net Interest Income and Noninterest Income\\n\\nThe table below presents the Corporation’s net interest income and noninterest income disaggregated by revenue source for 2022,\\n\\n2021 and 2020.

Interest rate, foreign exchange, equity, commodity\\n\\nand credit contracts are utilized in the Corporation\\'s ALM and\\n\\nrisk management activities.\\n\\nThe Corporation maintains an overall interest rate risk\\n\\nmanagement strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate\\n\\ncontracts, which are generally non-leveraged generic interest\\n\\nrate and basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, to\\n\\nminimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by interest\\n\\nrate volatility. The Corporation’s goal is to manage interest rate\\n\\nsensitivity and volatility so that movements in interest rates do\\n\\nnot significantly adversely affect earnings or capital. As a result\\n\\nof interest rate fluctuations, hedged fixed-rate assets and\\n\\nliabilities appreciate or depreciate in fair value. Gains or losses\\n\\non the derivative instruments that are linked to the hedged\\n\\nfixed-rate assets and liabilities are expected to substantially\\n\\noffset this unrealized appreciation or depreciation.\\n\\nMarket risk, including interest rate risk, can be substantial in\\n\\nthe mortgage business. Market risk in the mortgage business is\\n\\nthe risk that values of mortgage assets or revenues will be\\n\\nadversely affected by changes in market conditions such as\\n\\ninterest rate movements. To mitigate the interest rate risk in\\n\\nmortgage banking production income, the Corporation utilizes\\n\\nforward loan sale commitments and other derivative\\n\\ninstruments, including purchased options, and certain debt\\n\\nsecurities. The Corporation also utilizes derivatives such as\\n\\ninterest rate options, interest rate swaps, forward settlement\\n\\ncontracts and eurodollar futures to hedge certain market risks\\n\\nof MSRs.\\n\\nThe Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to manage\\n\\nthe foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign\\n\\ncurrency-denominated assets and liabilities, as well as the\\n\\nCorporation’s investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. Exposure to\\n\\nloss on these contracts will increase or decrease over their\\n\\nrespective lives as currency exchange and interest rates\\n\\nfluctuate.\\n\\nThe Corporation purchases credit derivatives to manage\\n\\ncredit risk related to certain funded and unfunded credit\\n\\nexposures. Credit derivatives include credit default swaps\\n\\n(CDS), total return swaps and swaptions. These derivatives are\\n\\nrecorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value with\\n\\nchanges in fair value recorded in other income.\\n\\nDerivatives Designated as Accounting Hedges\\n\\nThe Corporation uses various types of interest rate and foreign\\n\\nexchange derivative contracts to protect against changes in the\\n\\nfair value of its assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in\\n\\ninterest rates and foreign exchange rates (fair value hedges).\\n\\nThe Corporation also uses these types of contracts to protect\\n\\nagainst changes in the cash flows of its assets and liabilities,\\n\\nBank of America 2022 153\\n\\nand other forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges). The\\n\\nCorporation hedges its net investment in consolidated non-U.S.\\n\\noperations determined to have functional currencies other than\\n\\nthe U.S. dollar using forward exchange contracts and crosscurrency basis swaps, and by issuing foreign currency-\\n\\ndenominated debt (net investment hedges).\\n\\nFair Value Hedges\\n\\nThe table below summarizes information related to fair value\\n\\nhedges for 2022, 2021 and 2020.\\n\\nGains and Losses on Derivatives Designated as Fair Value Hedges\\n\\n(Dollars in millions)\\n\\nInterest rate risk on long-term debt (1)\\n\\nInterest rate and foreign currency risk on long-term debt (2)\\n\\nInterest rate risk on available-for-sale securities (3)\\n\\nPrice risk on commodity inventory (4)\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n(2)\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n(4)\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n2022\\n\\n(26,654)\\n\\n(120)\\n\\n21,991\\n\\n674\\n\\n(4,109)\\n\\nDerivative\\n\\n2021\\n\\n$\\n\\n(7,018)\\n\\n(90)\\n\\n5,203\\n\\n—\\n\\n$\\n\\n(1,905)\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n2020\\n\\n7,091\\n\\n783\\n\\n(44)\\n\\n—\\n\\n7,830\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n2022\\n\\n26,825\\n\\n119\\n\\n(22,280)\\n\\n(674)\\n\\n3,990\\n\\nHedged Item\\n\\n2021\\n\\n$\\n\\n6,838\\n\\n79\\n\\n(5,167)\\n\\n—\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,750\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n2020\\n\\n(7,220)\\n\\n(783)\\n\\n49\\n\\n—\\n\\n(7,954)\\n\\nAmounts are recorded in interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\\n\\nFor 2022, 2021 and 2020, the derivative amount includes gains (losses) of $(37) million, $(73) million and $701 million in interest expense, $(81) million, $0 and $73 million in market making\\n\\nand similar activities, and $(2) million, $(17) million and $9 million in accumulated OCI, respectively.

At both December 31, 2022\\n\\nand 2021, the Corporation had transferred $4.8 billion of nonU.S. government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities to a\\n\\nthird-party trust and retained economic exposure to the\\n\\ntransferred assets through derivative contracts. In connection\\n\\nwith these transfers, the Corporation received gross cash\\n\\nproceeds of $4.9 billion and $4.8 billion at the transfer dates.\\n\\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of the\\n\\ntransferred securities was $4.7 billion and $5.0 billion.\\n\\nSales and Trading Revenue\\n\\nThe Corporation enters into trading derivatives to facilitate client\\n\\ntransactions and to manage risk exposures arising from trading\\n\\naccount assets and liabilities. It is the Corporation’s policy to\\n\\ninclude these derivative instruments in its trading activities,\\n\\nwhich include derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments.\\n\\nThe resulting risk from these derivatives is managed on a\\n\\nportfolio basis as part of the Corporation’s Global Markets\\n\\nbusiness segment. The related sales and trading revenue\\n\\ngenerated within Global Markets is recorded in various income\\n\\nstatement line items, including market making and similar\\n\\nactivities and net interest income as well as other revenue\\n\\ncategories.\\n\\nSales and trading revenue includes changes in the fair value\\n\\nand realized gains and losses on the sales of trading and other\\n\\nassets, net interest income, and fees primarily from\\n\\ncommissions on equity securities. Revenue is generated by the\\n\\ndifference in the client price for an instrument and the price at\\n\\nwhich the trading desk can execute the trade in the dealer\\n\\nmarket. For equity securities, commissions related to purchases\\n\\nand sales are recorded in the “Other” column in the Sales and\\n\\nTrading Revenue table. Changes in the fair value of these\\n\\nsecurities are included in market making and similar activities.\\n\\nFor debt securities, revenue, with the exception of interest\\n\\nassociated with the debt securities, is typically included in\\n\\nmarket making and similar activities. Unlike commissions for\\n\\nequity securities, the initial revenue related to broker-dealer\\n\\nservices for debt securities is typically included in the pricing of\\n\\nthe instrument rather than being charged through separate fee\\n\\narrangements. Therefore, this revenue is recorded in market\\n\\nmaking and similar activities as part of the initial mark to fair\\n\\nvalue. For derivatives, the majority of revenue is included in\\n\\nmarket making and similar activities. In transactions where the\\n\\nCorporation acts as agent, which include exchange-traded\\n\\nfutures and options, fees are recorded in other income.\\n\\nThe table below, which includes both derivatives and nonderivative cash instruments, identifies the amounts in the\\n\\nrespective income statement line items attributable to the\\n\\nCorporation’s sales and trading revenue in Global Markets,\\n\\ncategorized by primary risk, for 2022, 2021 and 2020.

Credit derivatives derive value based on an\\n\\nunderlying third-party referenced obligation or a portfolio of\\n\\nreferenced obligations and generally require the Corporation, as\\n\\nthe seller of credit protection, to make payments to a buyer\\n\\nupon the occurrence of a predefined credit event. Such credit\\n\\nevents generally include bankruptcy of the referenced credit\\n\\nentity and failure to pay under the obligation, as well as\\n\\nacceleration of indebtedness and payment repudiation or\\n\\nmoratorium. For credit derivatives based on a portfolio of\\n\\nreferenced credits or credit indices, the Corporation may not be\\n\\nrequired to make payment until a specified amount of loss has\\n\\nBank of America 2022 155\\n\\noccurred and/or may only be required to make payment up to a\\n\\nspecified amount.\\n\\nCredit derivatives are classified as investment and noninvestment grade based on the credit quality of the underlying\\n\\nreferenced obligation.

These\\n\\ninstruments are primarily classified as trading securities. The\\n\\ncarrying value of these instruments equals the Corporation’s\\n\\nmaximum exposure to loss. The Corporation is not obligated to\\n\\nmake any payments to the entities under the terms of the\\n\\nsecurities owned.\\n\\nCredit-related Contingent Features and Collateral\\n\\nThe Corporation executes the majority of its derivative contracts\\n\\nin the OTC market with large, international financial institutions,\\n\\nincluding broker-dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety\\n\\nof non-financial companies. A significant majority of the\\n\\nderivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis.\\n\\nTherefore, events such as a credit rating downgrade (depending\\n\\non the ultimate rating level) or a breach of credit covenants\\n\\nwould typically require an increase in the amount of collateral\\n\\nrequired of the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow the\\n\\nCorporation to take additional protective measures such as\\n\\nearly termination of all trades. Further, as previously discussed\\n\\non page 152, the Corporation enters into legally enforceable\\n\\nmaster netting agreements that reduce risk by permitting\\n\\ncloseout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty\\n\\nupon the occurrence of certain events.\\n\\nCertain of the Corporation’s derivative contracts contain\\n\\ncredit risk-related contingent features, primarily in the form of\\n\\nISDA master netting agreements and credit support\\n\\ndocumentation that enhance the creditworthiness of these\\n\\ninstruments compared to other obligations of the respective\\n\\ncounterparty with whom the Corporation has transacted. These\\n\\ncontingent features may be for the benefit of the Corporation as\\n\\nwell as its counterparties with respect to changes in the\\n\\nCorporation’s creditworthiness and the mark-to-market exposure\\n\\nunder the derivative transactions. At December 31, 2022 and\\n\\n2021, the Corporation held cash and securities collateral of\\n\\n$101.3 billion and $91.4 billion and posted cash and securities\\n\\ncollateral of $81.2 billion and $79.3 billion in the normal course\\n\\nof business under derivative agreements, excluding crossproduct margining agreements where clients are permitted to\\n\\nmargin on a net basis for both derivative and secured financing\\n\\narrangements.\\n\\nIn connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other\\n\\ntrading agreements, the Corporation can be required to provide\\n\\nadditional collateral or to terminate transactions with certain\\n\\ncounterparties in the event of a downgrade of the senior debt\\n\\nratings of the Corporation or certain subsidiaries. The amount of\\n\\nadditional collateral required depends on the contract and is\\n\\nusually a fixed incremental amount and/or the market value of\\n\\nthe exposure.\\n\\nAt December 31, 2022, the amount of collateral, calculated\\n\\nbased on the terms of the contracts, that the Corporation and\\n\\ncertain subsidiaries could be required to post to counterparties\\n\\nbut had not yet posted to counterparties was $3.2 billion,\\n\\nincluding $1.6 billion for Bank of America, National Association\\n\\n(BANA).\\n\\nSome counterparties are currently able to unilaterally\\n\\nterminate certain contracts, or the Corporation or certain\\n\\nsubsidiaries may be required to take other action such as find a\\n\\nsuitable replacement or obtain a guarantee. At December 31,\\n\\n2022 and 2021, the liability recorded for these derivative\\n\\ncontracts was not significant.\\n\\nThe following table presents the amount of additional\\n\\ncollateral that would have been contractually required by\\n\\nderivative contracts and other trading agreements at\\n\\nDecember 31, 2022 if the rating agencies had downgraded their\\n\\nlong-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or certain\\n\\nsubsidiaries by one incremental notch and by an additional\\n\\nsecond incremental notch.

The Corporation\\n\\ncalculates valuation adjustments on derivatives based on a\\n\\nmodeled expected exposure that incorporates current market\\n\\nrisk factors. The exposure also takes into consideration credit\\n\\nmitigants such as enforceable master netting agreements and\\n\\ncollateral. CDS spread data is used to estimate the default\\n\\nprobabilities and severities that are applied to the exposures.\\n\\nWhere no observable credit default data is available for\\n\\ncounterparties, the Corporation uses proxies and other market\\n\\ndata to estimate default probabilities and severity.\\n\\nThe table below presents credit valuation adjustment (CVA),\\n\\nDVA and FVA gains (losses) on derivatives (excluding the effect\\n\\nof any related hedge activities), which are recorded in market\\n\\nmaking and similar activities, for 2022, 2021 and 2020. CVA\\n\\ngains reduce the cumulative CVA thereby increasing the\\n\\nderivative assets balance. DVA gains increase the cumulative\\n\\nDVA thereby decreasing the derivative liabilities balance. CVA\\n\\nand DVA losses have the opposite impact. FVA gains related to\\n\\nderivative assets reduce the cumulative FVA thereby increasing\\n\\nthe derivative assets balance. FVA gains related to derivative\\n\\nliabilities increase the cumulative FVA thereby decreasing the\\n\\nderivative liabilities balance.

Within the\\n\\nConsumer Real Estate portfolio segment, the primary credit\\n\\nquality indicators are refreshed LTV and refreshed Fair Isaac\\n\\nCorporation (FICO) score. Refreshed LTV measures the carrying\\n\\nvalue of the loan as a percentage of the value of the property\\n\\nsecuring the loan, refreshed quarterly. Home equity loans are\\n\\nevaluated using CLTV, which measures the carrying value of the\\n\\nCorporation’s loan and available line of credit combined with any\\n\\noutstanding senior liens against the property as a percentage of\\n\\nthe value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly.\\n\\nFICO score measures the creditworthiness of the borrower\\n\\nbased on the financial obligations of the borrower and the\\n\\nborrower’s credit history. FICO scores are typically refreshed\\n\\nquarterly or more frequently. Certain borrowers (e.g., borrowers\\n\\nthat have had debts discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding) may\\n\\nnot have their FICO scores updated. FICO scores are also a\\n\\nprimary credit quality indicator for the Credit Card and Other\\n\\nConsumer portfolio segment and the business card portfolio\\n\\nwithin U.S. small business commercial. Within the Commercial\\n\\nportfolio segment, loans are evaluated using the internal\\n\\nclassifications of pass rated or reservable criticized as the\\n\\nprimary credit quality indicators. The term reservable criticized\\n\\nrefers to those commercial loans that are internally classified or\\n\\nlisted by the Corporation as Special Mention, Substandard or\\n\\nDoubtful, which are asset quality categories defined by\\n\\nregulatory authorities. These assets have an elevated level of\\n\\nrisk and may have a high probability of default or total loss.\\n\\nPass rated refers to all loans not considered reservable\\n\\ncriticized. In addition to these primary credit quality indicators,\\n\\nthe Corporation uses other credit quality indicators for certain\\n\\ntypes of loans.\\n\\nThe following tables present certain credit quality indicators\\n\\nand gross charge-offs for the Corporation\\'s Consumer Real\\n\\nEstate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial\\n\\nportfolio segments by year of origination, except

Each modification is unique and\\n\\nreflects the individual circumstances of the borrower.\\n\\nModifications that result in a TDR may include extensions of\\n\\nmaturity at a concessionary (below market) rate of interest,\\n\\npayment forbearances or other actions designed to benefit the\\n\\nborrower while mitigating the Corporation’s risk exposure.\\n\\nBank of America 2022 169\\n\\nReductions in interest rates are rare. Instead, the interest rates\\n\\nare typically increased, although the increased rate may not\\n\\nrepresent a market rate of interest. Infrequently, concessions\\n\\nmay also include principal forgiveness in connection with\\n\\nforeclosure, short sale or other settlement agreements leading\\n\\nto termination or sale of the loan.\\n\\nAt the time of restructuring, the loans are remeasured to\\n\\nreflect the impact, if any, on projected cash flows resulting from\\n\\nthe modified terms. If a portion of the loan is deemed to be\\n\\nuncollectible, a charge-off may be recorded at the time of\\n\\nrestructuring. Alternatively, a charge-off may have already been\\n\\nrecorded in a previous period such that no charge-off is required\\n\\nat the time of modification.\\n\\nDuring 2022, the carrying value of the Corporation’s\\n\\ncommercial loans that were modified as TDRs was $1.9 billion\\n\\ncompared to $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion for 2021 and 2020. At\\n\\nDecember 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation had\\n\\ncommitments to lend $358 million, $283 million and $402\\n\\nmillion to commercial borrowers whose loans were classified as\\n\\nTDRs. The balance of commercial TDRs in payment default was\\n\\n$105 million, $262 million and $218 million at December 31,\\n\\n2022, 2021 and 2020.\\n\\nLoans Held-for-sale\\n\\nThe Corporation had LHFS of $6.9 billion and $15.6 billion at\\n\\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021. Cash and non-cash proceeds\\n\\nfrom sales and paydowns of loans originally classified as LHFS\\n\\nwere $32.0 billion, $43.6 billion and $20.1 billion for 2022,\\n\\n2021 and 2020, respectively. Cash used for originations and\\n\\npurchases of LHFS totaled $24.9 billion, $37.3 billion and\\n\\n$19.7 billion for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Also\\n\\nincluded were non-cash net transfers into LHFS of $1.9 billion\\n\\nduring 2022, primarily driven by the transfer of a $1.6 billion\\n\\naffinity card loan portfolio to held for sale that was sold in\\n\\nOctober 2022, and $808 million during 2021.\\n\\nAccrued Interest Receivable\\n\\nAccrued interest receivable for loans and leases and loans heldfor-sale at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $3.8 billion and\\n\\n$2.2 billion and is reported in customer and other receivables\\n\\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\\n\\nOutstanding credit card loan balances include unpaid\\n\\nprincipal, interest and fees. Credit card loans are not classified\\n\\nas nonperforming but are charged off no later than the end of\\n\\nthe month in which the account becomes 180 days past due,\\n\\nwithin 60 days after receipt of notification of death or\\n\\nbankruptcy, or upon confirmation of fraud. During 2022 and\\n\\n2021, the Corporation reversed $332 million and $446 million\\n\\nof interest and fee income against the income statement line\\n\\nitem in which it was originally recorded upon charge-off of the\\n\\nprincipal balance of the loan.\\n\\nFor the outstanding residential mortgage, home equity,\\n\\ndirect/indirect consumer and commercial loan balances\\n\\nclassified as nonperforming during 2022 and 2021, interest and\\n\\nfee income reversed at the time the loans were classified as\\n\\nnonperforming was not significant. For more information on the\\n\\nCorporation\\'s nonperforming loan policies, see Note 1 –\\n\\nSummary of Significant Accounting Principles.\\n\\nAllowance for Credit Losses\\n\\nThe allowance for credit losses is estimated using quantitative\\n\\nand qualitative methods that consider a variety of factors, such\\n\\nas historical loss experience, the current credit quality of the\\n\\nportfolio and an economic outlook over the life of the loan.\\n\\nQualitative reserves cover losses that are expected but, in the\\n\\nCorporation\\'s assessment, may not be adequately reflected in\\n\\n170 Bank of America 2022\\n\\nthe quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. The\\n\\nCorporation incorporates forward-looking information through the\\n\\nuse of several macroeconomic scenarios in determining the\\n\\nweighted economic outlook over the forecasted life of the\\n\\nassets. These scenarios include key macroeconomic variables\\n\\nsuch as gross domestic product, unemployment rate, real\\n\\nestate prices and corporate bond spreads. The scenarios that\\n\\nare chosen each quarter and the weighting given to each\\n\\nscenario depend on a variety of factors including recent\\n\\neconomic events, leading economic indicators, internal and\\n\\nthird-party economist views, and industry trends. For more\\n\\ninformation on the Corporation\\'s credit loss accounting policies\\n\\nincluding the allowance for credit losses, see Note 1 – Summary\\n\\nof Significant Accounting Principles.\\n\\nThe December 31, 2022 estimate for allowance for credit\\n\\nlosses was based on various economic scenarios, including a\\n\\nbaseline scenario derived from consensus estimates, an\\n\\nadverse scenario reflecting an extended moderate recession, a\\n\\ndownside scenario reflecting persistent inflation and interest\\n\\nrates above the baseline scenario, a tail risk scenario similar to\\n\\nthe severely adverse scenario used in stress testing and an\\n\\nupside scenario that considers the potential for improvement\\n\\nabove the baseline scenario. The overall economic outlook is\\n\\nweighted 95 percent towards a recessionary environment in\\n\\n2023, with continued inflationary pressures leading to lower\\n\\nGDP and higher unemployment rate expectations as compared\\n\\nto the prior year. The weighted economic outlook assumes that\\n\\nthe U.S. average unemployment rate will be above five and a\\n\\nhalf percent by the fourth quarter of 2023 and will slowly decline\\n\\nto five percent by the fourth quarter of 2024. Additionally, in this\\n\\neconomic outlook, U.S. gross domestic product is forecasted to\\n\\ncontract at 0.4 percent and grow at 1.2 percent year-over-year in\\n\\nthe fourth quarters of 2023 and 2024. For comparison, as of\\n\\nDecember 31, 2021, the weighted economic outlook for the\\n\\nU.S. average unemployment rate was forecasted to be just\\n\\nabove five percent by the fourth quarter of 2022 and slowly\\n\\ndecline to just under five percent by the fourth quarter of 2023\\n\\nand U.S. gross domestic product was forecasted at 2.1 percent\\n\\nand 1.9 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarters of 2022\\n\\nand 2023.\\n\\nThe allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2022 was\\n\\n$14.2 billion, an increase of $379 million compared to\\n\\nDecember 31, 2021. The increase in the allowance for credit\\n\\nlosses was primarily driven by loan growth and a dampened\\n\\nmacroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reserve release for\\n\\nreduced pandemic uncertainties. The change in the allowance\\n\\nfor credit losses was comprised of a net increase of $295\\n\\nmillion in the allowance for loan and lease losses and an\\n\\nincrease of $84 million in the reserve for unfunded lending\\n\\ncommitments. The increase in the allowance for credit losses\\n\\nwas attributed to increases in the credit card and other\\n\\nconsumer portfolios of $341 million, and commercial portfolio of\\n\\n$177 million, partially offset by a decrease in the consumer real\\n\\nestate portfolio of $139 million. The provision for credit losses\\n\\nincreased $7.1 billion to an expense of $2.5 billion in 2022\\n\\ncompared to a benefit of $4.6 billion in 2021 and an expense of\\n\\n$11.3 billion in 2020. The increase in the provision for credit\\n\\nlosses in 2022 was primarily driven by loan growth and a\\n\\ndampened macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by reduced\\n\\npandemic uncertainties. The benefit in 2021 was primarily due\\n\\nto an improved macroeconomic outlook and credit quality.\\n\\nOutstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for\\n\\nunder the fair value option increased $68.7 billion in 2022\\n\\nprimarily driven by commercial loans, which increased $47.7\\n\\nbillion, driven by broad-based growth, and consumer loans which\\n\\nincreased $21.0 billion, primarily driven by credit card and\\n\\nresidential mortgage.\\n\\nThe changes in the allowance for credit losses, including net\\n\\ncharge-offs and provision for loan and lease losses, are detailed\\n\\nin the table below.\\n\\nConsumer\\n\\nReal Estate\\n\\n(Dollars in millions)\\n\\nAllowance for loan and lease losses, January 1\\n\\nLoans and leases charged off\\n\\nRecoveries of loans and leases previously charged off\\n\\nNet charge-offs\\n\\nProvision for loan and lease losses\\n\\nOther\\n\\nAllowance for loan and lease losses, December 31\\n\\nReserve for unfunded lending commitments, January 1\\n\\nProvision for unfunded lending commitments\\n\\nOther\\n\\nReserve for unfunded lending commitments, December 31\\n\\nAllowance for credit losses, December 31\\n\\nAllowance for loan and lease losses, January 1\\n\\nLoans and leases charged off\\n\\nRecoveries of loans and leases previously charged off\\n\\nNet charge-offs\\n\\nProvision for loan and lease losses\\n\\nOther\\n\\nAllowance for loan and lease losses, December 31\\n\\nReserve for unfunded lending commitments, January 1\\n\\nProvision for unfunded lending commitments\\n\\nOther\\n\\nReserve for unfunded lending commitments, December 31\\n\\nAllowance for credit losses, December 31\\n\\nAllowance for loan and lease losses, January 1\\n\\nLoans and leases charged off\\n\\nRecoveries of loans and leases previously charged off\\n\\nNet charge-offs\\n\\nProvision for loan and lease losses\\n\\nOther\\n\\nAllowance for loan and lease losses, December 31\\n\\nReserve for unfunded lending commitments, January 1\\n\\nProvision for unfunded lending commitments\\n\\nReserve for unfunded lending commitments, December 31\\n\\nAllowance for credit losses, December 31\\n\\nNOTE 6 Securitizations and Other Variable\\n\\nInterest Entities\\n\\nThe Corporation utilizes VIEs in the ordinary course of business\\n\\nto support its own and its customers’ financing and investing\\n\\nneeds. The Corporation routinely securitizes loans and debt\\n\\nsecurities using VIEs as a source of funding for the Corporation\\n\\nand as a means of transferring the economic risk of the loans or\\n\\ndebt securities to third parties. The assets are transferred into a\\n\\ntrust or other securitization vehicle such that the assets are\\n\\nlegally isolated from the creditors of the Corporation and are not\\n\\navailable to satisfy its obligations. These assets can only be\\n\\nused to settle obligations of the trust or other securitization\\n\\nvehicle.

These securities serve as a form of credit enhancement\\n\\nto the senior debt securities and have a stated interest rate of\\n\\nzero percent. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, the credit card\\n\\nsecuritization trust issued $363 million, $161 million and $161\\n\\nmillion, respectively, of these subordinate securities.\\n\\nThe Corporation resecuritized $21.8 billion, $28.9 billion\\n\\nand $39.0 billion of securities during 2022, 2021 and 2020,\\n\\nrespectively.

CDOs are\\n\\ngenerally managed by third-party portfolio managers. The\\n\\nCorporation typically transfers assets to these CDOs, holds\\n\\nsecurities issued by the CDOs and may be a derivative\\n\\ncounterparty to the CDOs.

At\\n\\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation’s consolidated\\n\\ninvestment VIEs had total assets of $854 million and $1.0\\n\\nbillion. The Corporation also held investments in unconsolidated\\n\\nVIEs with total assets of $12.2 billion and $7.1 billion at\\n\\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021. The Corporation’s maximum\\n\\nloss exposure associated with both consolidated and\\n\\nunconsolidated investment VIEs totaled $2.4 billion and $2.0\\n\\nbillion at December 31, 2022 and 2021 comprised primarily of\\n\\non-balance sheet assets less non-recourse liabilities.\\n\\nLeveraged Lease Trusts\\n\\nThe Corporation’s net investment in consolidated leveraged\\n\\nlease trusts totaled $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion at\\n\\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021. The trusts hold long-lived\\n\\nequipment such as rail cars, power generation and distribution\\n\\nequipment, and commercial aircraft. The Corporation structures\\n\\nthe trusts and holds a significant residual interest. The net\\n\\ninvestment represents the Corporation’s maximum loss\\n\\nexposure to the trusts in the unlikely event that the leveraged\\n\\nlease investments become worthless. Debt issued by the\\n\\nleveraged lease trusts is non-recourse to the Corporation.\\n\\nTax Credit VIEs\\n\\nThe Corporation holds investments in unconsolidated limited\\n\\npartnerships and similar entities that construct, own and\\n\\noperate affordable housing, wind and solar projects. An\\n\\nunrelated third party is typically the general partner or managing\\n\\nmember and has control over the significant activities of the VIE.\\n\\nAs an investor, tax credits associated with the investments in\\n\\nthese entities are allocated to the Corporation, as provided by\\n\\nthe U.S. Internal Revenue Code and related regulations, and are\\n\\nrecognized as income tax benefits in the Corporation’s\\n\\nConsolidated Statement of Income in the year they are earned,\\n\\nwhich varies based on the type of investments. Tax credits from\\n\\nenvironmental, social and governance (ESG) investments in\\n\\naffordable housing are recognized ratably over a term of up to\\n\\n10 years, and tax credits from wind and solar energy\\n\\ninvestments are recognized either at inception for transactions\\n\\nelecting Investment Tax Credits (ITCs) or as energy is produced\\n\\nfor transactions electing Production Tax Credits (PTCs), which is\\n\\ngenerally up to a 10-year time period. The volume and types of\\n\\ninvestments held by the Corporation will influence the amount of\\n\\ntax credits recognized each period. The maximum loss exposure\\n\\nincluded in the Other VIEs table was $28.8 billion and $25.7\\n\\nbillion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. In addition to that\\n\\namount, the Corporation had unfunded capital contributions for\\n\\nrenewable energy investments of $1.9 billion and $1.0 billion at\\n\\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021. The capital contributions are\\n\\ncontingent on various conditions precedent to funding over the\\n\\nnext two years. The Corporation’s risk of loss is generally\\n\\nmitigated by policies requiring that the project qualify for the\\n\\nexpected tax credits prior to making its investment.\\n\\nThe Corporation’s investments in affordable housing\\n\\npartnerships, which are reported in other assets on the\\n\\nConsolidated Balance Sheet, totaled $14.1 billion and $12.6\\n\\nbillion, including unfunded commitments to provide capital\\n\\ncontributions of $6.6 billion and $5.8 billion, at December 31,\\n\\n2022 and 2021. The unfunded commitments are expected to\\n\\nbe paid over the next five years. During 2022, 2021 and 2020,\\n\\nthe Corporation recognized tax credits and other tax benefits of\\n\\n$1.5 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion and reported pretax\\n\\nlosses in other income of $1.2 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.0\\n\\nbillion. These tax credits are recognized as part of the\\n\\nCorporation’s annual effective tax rate used to determine tax\\n\\nexpense in a given quarter.

The\\n\\nBank of America 2022 179\\n\\nCorporation’s goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that\\n\\nmovements in interest rates do not have a significantly adverse\\n\\neffect on earnings and capital. The weighted-average rates are\\n\\nthe contractual interest rates on the debt and do not reflect the\\n\\nimpacts of derivative transactions.\\n\\nThe table below shows the carrying value for aggregate\\n\\nannual contractual maturities of long-term debt as of\\n\\nDecember 31, 2022. Included in the table are certain structured\\n\\nnotes issued by the Corporation that contain provisions whereby\\n\\nthe borrowings are redeemable at the option of the holder (put\\n\\noptions) at specified dates prior to maturity. Other structured\\n\\nnotes have coupon or repayment terms linked to the\\n\\nperformance of debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or\\n\\ncommodities, and the maturity may be accelerated based on the\\n\\nvalue of a referenced index or security. In both cases, the\\n\\nCorporation or a subsidiary may be required to settle the\\n\\nobligation for cash or other securities prior to the contractual\\n\\nmaturity date.

The following\\n\\ntable includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding\\n\\nlending commitments net of amounts distributed (i.e.,\\n\\nsyndicated or participated) to other financial institutions. The\\n\\ndistributed amounts were $10.4 billion and $10.7 billion at\\n\\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021.

Amounts in the table include consumer SBLCs of $575 million\\n\\nand $512 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021.\\n\\nPrimarily includes second-loss positions on lease-end residual value guarantees.\\n\\nIncludes business card unused lines of credit.\\n\\nOther Commitments\\n\\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation had\\n\\ncommitments to purchase loans (e.g., residential mortgage and\\n\\ncommercial real estate) of $636 million and $181 million, which\\n\\nupon settlement will be included in trading account assets,\\n\\nloans or LHFS, and commitments to purchase commercial loans\\n\\nof $294 million and $518 million, which upon settlement will be\\n\\nincluded in trading account assets.\\n\\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation had\\n\\ncommitments to purchase commodities, primarily liquefied\\n\\nnatural gas, of $0 and $949 million, which upon settlement will\\n\\nbe included in trading account assets.\\n\\nAt both December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation had\\n\\ncommitments to enter into resale and forward-dated resale and\\n\\nsecurities borrowing agreements of $92.0 billion, and\\n\\ncommitments to enter into forward-dated repurchase and\\n\\nsecurities lending agreements of $57.8 billion and $32.6 billion\\n\\nas of both period ends. These commitments generally expire\\n\\nwithin the next 12 months.\\n\\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation had a\\n\\ncommitment to originate or purchase up to $3.7 billion and\\n\\n$4.0 billion on a rolling 12-month basis, of auto loans and\\n\\nleases from a strategic partner. This commitment extends\\n\\nthrough November 2026 and can be terminated with 12 months\\n\\nprior notice.\\n\\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation had\\n\\nunfunded equity investment commitments of $571 million and\\n\\n$395 million.\\n\\nOther Guarantees\\n\\nBank-owned Life Insurance Book Value Protection\\n\\nThe Corporation sells products that offer book value protection\\n\\nto insurance carriers who offer group life insurance policies to\\n\\ncorporations, primarily banks. At December 31, 2022 and\\n\\n2021, the notional amount of these guarantees totaled $4.3\\n\\nbillion and $6.3 billion. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the\\n\\nCorporation’s maximum exposure related to these guarantees\\n\\ntotaled $632 million and $928 million, with estimated maturity\\n\\ndates between 2033 and 2039.\\n\\nIndemnifications\\n\\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Corporation enters into\\n\\nvarious agreements that contain indemnifications, such as tax\\n\\nindemnifications, whereupon payment may become due if\\n\\ncertain external events occur, such as a change in tax law. The\\n\\nindemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms\\n\\nand were entered into in the normal course of business based\\n\\non an assessment that the risk of loss would be remote. These\\n\\nagreements typically contain an early termination clause that\\n\\npermits the Corporation to exit the agreement upon these\\n\\nevents. The maximum potential future payment under\\n\\nindemnification agreements is difficult to assess for several\\n\\nreasons, including the occurrence of an external event, the\\n\\ninability to predict future changes in tax and other laws, the\\n\\ndifficulty in determining how such laws would apply to parties in\\n\\ncontracts, the absence of exposure limits contained in standard\\n\\ncontract language and the timing of any early termination\\n\\nclauses. Historically, any payments made under these\\n\\nguarantees have been de minimis. The Corporation has\\n\\nassessed the probability of making such payments in the future\\n\\nas remote.\\n\\nMerchant Services\\n\\nThe Corporation in its role as merchant acquirer or as a sponsor\\n\\nof other merchant acquirers may be held liable for any reversed\\n\\ncharges that cannot be collected from the merchants, due to,\\n\\namong other things, merchant fraud or insolvency. If charges are\\n\\nproperly reversed after a purchase and cannot be collected from\\n\\neither the merchants or merchant acquirers, the Corporation\\n\\nmay be held liable for these reversed charges. The ability to\\n\\nreverse a charge is primarily governed by the applicable\\n\\nBank of America 2022 181\\n\\npayment network rules and regulations, which include, but are\\n\\nnot limited to, the type of charge, type of payment used and\\n\\ntime limits. The total amount of transactions subject to reversal\\n\\nunder payment network rules and regulations processed for the\\n\\npreceding six-month period, which was approximately $501\\n\\nbillion, is an estimate of the Corporation’s maximum potential\\n\\nexposure as of December 31, 2022. The Corporation’s risk in\\n\\nthis area primarily relates to circumstances where a cardholder\\n\\nhas purchased goods or services for future delivery. The\\n\\nCorporation mitigates this risk by requiring cash deposits,\\n\\nguarantees, letters of credit or other types of collateral from\\n\\ncertain merchants. The Corporation’s reserves for contingent\\n\\nlosses and the losses incurred related to the merchant\\n\\nprocessing activity were not significant.\\n\\nExchange and Clearing House Member Guarantees\\n\\nThe Corporation is a member of various securities and derivative\\n\\nexchanges and clearinghouses, both in the U.S. and other\\n\\ncountries. As a member, the Corporation may be required to pay\\n\\na pro-rata share of the losses incurred by some of these\\n\\norganizations as a result of another member default and under\\n\\nother loss scenarios. The Corporation’s potential obligations\\n\\nmay be limited to its membership interests in such exchanges\\n\\nand clearinghouses, to the amount (or multiple) of the\\n\\nCorporation’s contribution to the guarantee fund or, in limited\\n\\ninstances, to the full pro-rata share of the residual losses after\\n\\napplying the guarantee fund. The Corporation’s maximum\\n\\npotential exposure under these membership agreements is\\n\\ndifficult to estimate; however, the Corporation has assessed the\\n\\nprobability of making any such payments as remote.\\n\\nPrime Brokerage and Securities Clearing Services\\n\\nIn connection with its prime brokerage and clearing businesses,\\n\\nthe Corporation performs securities clearance and settlement\\n\\nservices with other brokerage firms and clearinghouses on\\n\\nbehalf of its clients. Under these arrangements, the Corporation\\n\\nstands ready to meet the obligations of its clients with respect\\n\\nto securities transactions. The Corporation’s obligations in this\\n\\nrespect are secured by the assets in the clients’ accounts and\\n\\nthe accounts of their customers as well as by any proceeds\\n\\nreceived from the transactions cleared and settled by the\\n\\nCorporation on behalf of clients or their customers. The\\n\\nCorporation’s maximum potential exposure under these\\n\\narrangements is difficult to estimate; however, the potential for\\n\\nthe Corporation to incur material losses pursuant to these\\n\\narrangements is remote.\\n\\nFixed Income Clearing Corporation Sponsored Member\\n\\nRepo Program\\n\\nThe Corporation acts as a sponsoring member in a repo\\n\\nprogram whereby the Corporation clears certain eligible resale\\n\\nand repurchase agreements through the Government Securities\\n\\nDivision of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation on behalf of\\n\\nclients that are sponsored members in accordance with the\\n\\nFixed Income Clearing Corporation’s rules. As part of this\\n\\nprogram, the Corporation guarantees the payment and\\n\\nperformance of its sponsored members to the Fixed Income\\n\\nClearing Corporation. The Corporation’s guarantee obligation is\\n\\nsecured by a security interest in cash or high-quality securities\\n\\ncollateral placed by clients with the clearinghouse and therefore,\\n\\nthe potential for the Corporation to incur significant losses\\n\\nunder this arrangement is remote. The Corporation’s maximum\\n\\npotential exposure, without taking into consideration the related\\n\\ncollateral, was $59.6 billion and $42.0 billion at December 31,\\n\\n2022 and 2021.\\n\\n182 Bank of America 2022\\n\\nOther Guarantees\\n\\nIn the normal course of business, the Corporation periodically\\n\\nguarantees the obligations of its affiliates in a variety of\\n\\ntransactions including ISDA-related transactions and non-ISDA\\n\\nrelated transactions such as commodities trading, repurchase\\n\\nagreements, prime brokerage agreements and other\\n\\ntransactions.\\n\\nGuarantees of Certain Long-term Debt\\n\\nThe Corporation, as the parent company, fully and\\n\\nunconditionally guarantees the securities issued by BofA\\n\\nFinance LLC, a consolidated finance subsidiary of the\\n\\nCorporation, and effectively provides for the full and\\n\\nunconditional guarantee of trust securities issued by certain\\n\\nstatutory trust companies that are 100 percent owned finance\\n\\nsubsidiaries of the Corporation.\\n\\nRepresentations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate\\n\\nGuarantees\\n\\nThe Corporation securitizes first-lien residential mortgage loans\\n\\ngenerally in the form of RMBS guaranteed by the GSEs or by\\n\\nGNMA in the case of FHA-insured, VA-guaranteed and Rural\\n\\nHousing Service-guaranteed mortgage loans, and sells pools of\\n\\nfirst-lien residential mortgage loans in the form of whole loans.\\n\\nIn addition, in prior years, legacy companies and certain\\n\\nsubsidiaries sold pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans\\n\\nand home equity loans as private-label securitizations or in the\\n\\nform of whole loans. In connection with these transactions, the\\n\\nCorporation or certain of its subsidiaries or legacy companies\\n\\nmake and have made various representations and warranties.\\n\\nBreaches of these representations and warranties have resulted\\n\\nin and may continue to result in the requirement to repurchase\\n\\nmortgage loans or to otherwise make whole or provide\\n\\nindemnification or other remedies to sponsors, investors,\\n\\nsecuritization trusts, guarantors, insurers or other parties\\n\\n(collectively, repurchases).\\n\\nUnresolved Repurchase Claims\\n\\nUnresolved representations and warranties repurchase claims\\n\\nrepresent the notional amount of repurchase claims made by\\n\\ncounterparties, typically the outstanding principal balance or the\\n\\nunpaid principal balance at the time of default. In the case of\\n\\nfirst-lien mortgages, the claim amount is often significantly\\n\\ngreater than the expected loss amount due to the benefit of\\n\\ncollateral and, in some cases, mortgage insurance or mortgage\\n\\nguarantee payments.\\n\\nThe notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims at\\n\\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021 was $5.5 billion and $8.4\\n\\nbillion. These balances included $2.2 billion and $2.8 billion at\\n\\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021 of claims related to loans in\\n\\nspecific private-label securitization groups or tranches where the\\n\\nCorporation owns substantially all of the outstanding securities\\n\\nor will otherwise realize the benefit of any repurchase claims\\n\\npaid.\\n\\nDuring 2022, the Corporation received $82 million in new\\n\\nrepurchase claims that were not time-barred. During 2022, $3.0\\n\\nbillion in claims were resolved.\\n\\nReserve and Related Provision\\n\\nThe reserve for representations and warranties obligations and\\n\\ncorporate guarantees was $612 million and $1.2 billion at\\n\\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021 and is included in accrued\\n\\nexpenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance\\n\\nSheet, and the related provision is included in other income in\\n\\nthe Consolidated Statement of Income. The representations and\\n\\nwarranties reserve represents the Corporation’s best estimate\\n\\nof probable incurred losses, is based on its experience in\\n\\nprevious negotiations, and is subject to judgment, a variety of\\n\\nassumptions, and known or unknown uncertainties. Future\\n\\nrepresentations and warranties losses may occur in excess of\\n\\nthe amounts recorded for these exposures; however, the\\n\\nCorporation does not expect such amounts to be material to the\\n\\nCorporation\\'s financial condition and liquidity. See Litigation and\\n\\nRegulatory Matters below for the Corporation\\'s combined range\\n\\nof possible loss in excess of the reserve for representations\\n\\nand warranties and the accrued liability for litigation.\\n\\nLitigation and Regulatory Matters\\n\\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Corporation and its\\n\\nsubsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to many\\n\\npending and threatened legal, regulatory and governmental\\n\\nactions and proceedings. In view of the inherent difficulty of\\n\\npredicting the outcome of such matters, particularly where the\\n\\nclaimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where\\n\\nthe matters present novel legal theories or involve a large\\n\\nnumber of parties, the Corporation generally cannot predict the\\n\\neventual outcome of the pending matters, timing of the ultimate\\n\\nresolution of these matters, or eventual loss, fines or penalties\\n\\nrelated to each pending matter.\\n\\nAs a matter develops, the Corporation, in conjunction with\\n\\nany outside counsel handling the matter, evaluates whether\\n\\nsuch matter presents a loss contingency that is probable and\\n\\nestimable, and, for the matters below, whether a loss in excess\\n\\nof any accrued liability is reasonably possible in future periods.\\n\\nOnce the loss contingency is deemed to be both probable and\\n\\nestimable, the Corporation will establish an accrued liability and\\n\\nrecord a corresponding amount of expense. The Corporation\\n\\ncontinues to monitor the matter for further developments that\\n\\ncould affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been\\n\\npreviously established. Excluding expenses of internal and\\n\\nexternal legal service providers, litigation and regulatory\\n\\ninvestigation-related expense of $1.2 billion and $164 million\\n\\nwas recognized in 2022 and 2021.\\n\\nFor any matter disclosed in this Note for which a loss in\\n\\nfuture periods is reasonably possible and estimable (whether in\\n\\nexcess of an accrued liability or where there is no accrued\\n\\nliability) and for representations and warranties exposures, the\\n\\nCorporation’s estimated range of possible loss is $0 to $0.8\\n\\nbillion in excess of the accrued liability, if any, as of\\n\\nDecember 31, 2022.\\n\\nThe accrued liability and estimated range of possible loss\\n\\nare based upon currently available information and subject to\\n\\nsignificant judgment, a variety of assumptions and known and\\n\\nunknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the accrued\\n\\nliability and estimated range of possible loss are unpredictable\\n\\nand may change from time to time, and actual losses may vary\\n\\nsignificantly from the current estimate and accrual. The\\n\\nestimated range of possible loss does not represent the\\n\\nCorporation’s maximum loss exposure.\\n\\nInformation is provided below regarding the nature of the\\n\\nlitigation and, where specified, associated claimed damages.\\n\\nBased on current knowledge, and taking into account accrued\\n\\nliabilities, management does not believe that loss contingencies\\n\\narising from pending matters, including the matters described\\n\\nbelow, will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated\\n\\nfinancial condition or liquidity of the Corporation. However, in\\n\\nlight of the significant judgment, variety of assumptions and\\n\\nuncertainties involved in those matters, some of which are\\n\\nbeyond the Corporation’s control, and the very large or\\n\\nindeterminate damages sought in some of those matters, an\\n\\nadverse outcome in one or more of those matters could be\\n\\nmaterial to the Corporation’s business or results of operations\\n\\nfor any particular reporting period, or cause significant\\n\\nreputational harm.\\n\\nDeposit Insurance Assessment\\n\\nOn January 9, 2017, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\\n\\n(FDIC) filed suit against BANA in the U.S. District Court for the\\n\\nDistrict of Columbia (“District Court”) alleging failure to pay a\\n\\nDecember 15, 2016 invoice for additional deposit insurance\\n\\nassessments and interest in the amount of $542 million for the\\n\\nquarters ending June 30, 2013 through December 31, 2014.\\n\\nOn April 7, 2017, the FDIC amended its complaint to add a\\n\\nclaim for additional deposit insurance and interest in the\\n\\namount of $583 million for the quarters ending March 31, 2012\\n\\nthrough March 31, 2013. The FDIC asserts these claims based\\n\\non BANA’s alleged underreporting of counterparty exposures\\n\\nthat resulted in underpayment of assessments for those\\n\\nquarters, and its Enforcement Section is also conducting a\\n\\nparallel investigation related to the same alleged reporting error.\\n\\nBANA disagrees with the FDIC’s interpretation of the regulations\\n\\nas they existed during the relevant time period and is defending\\n\\nitself against the FDIC’s claims. Pending final resolution, BANA\\n\\nhas pledged security satisfactory to the FDIC related to the\\n\\ndisputed additional assessment amounts. On March 27, 2018,\\n\\nthe District Court denied BANA’s partial motion to dismiss\\n\\ncertain of the FDIC’s claims. On January 24, 2023, the\\n\\nmagistrate judge assigned to the matter by the District Court\\n\\njudge held oral argument on the parties’ motions for summary\\n\\njudgment and took the motions under advisement.\\n\\nLIBOR\\n\\nThe Corporation, BANA and certain Merrill Lynch entities have\\n\\nbeen named as defendants along with most of the other LIBOR\\n\\npanel banks in a number of individual and putative class actions\\n\\nby persons alleging they sustained losses on U.S. dollar LIBORbased financial instruments as a result of collusion or\\n\\nmanipulation by defendants regarding the setting of U.S. dollar\\n\\nLIBOR. Plaintiffs assert a variety of claims, including antitrust,\\n\\nCommodity Exchange Act, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt\\n\\nOrganizations (RICO), Securities Exchange Act of 1934, common\\n\\nlaw fraud and breach of contract claims, and seek\\n\\ncompensatory, treble and punitive damages, and injunctive\\n\\nrelief. All but one of the cases naming the Corporation and its\\n\\naffiliates relating to U.S. dollar LIBOR are pending in the U.S.\\n\\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York (“District\\n\\nCourt”). The District Court has dismissed all RICO claims, and\\n\\ndismissed all manipulation claims against Bank of America\\n\\nentities based on alleged trader conduct. The District Court has\\n\\nalso substantially limited the scope of antitrust, Commodity\\n\\nExchange Act and various other claims, including by dismissing\\n\\nin their entirety certain individual and putative class plaintiffs’\\n\\nantitrust claims for lack of standing. On December 30, 2021,\\n\\nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the\\n\\ndismissal of these antitrust claims for lack of standing. Certain\\n\\nindividual and putative class actions remain pending against the\\n\\nCorporation, BANA and certain Merrill Lynch entities. On\\n\\nFebruary 28, 2018, the District Court granted certification of a\\n\\nclass of persons that purchased OTC swaps and notes that\\n\\nreferenced U.S. dollar LIBOR from one of the U.S. dollar LIBOR\\n\\npanel banks, limited to claims under Section 1 of the Sherman\\n\\nAct.\\n\\nBank of America 2022 183\\n\\nNOTE 13 Shareholders’ Equity\\n\\nCommon Stock\\n\\nDeclared Quarterly Cash Dividends on Common Stock (1)\\n\\nDeclaration Date\\n\\nFebruary 1, 2023\\n\\nOctober 19, 2022\\n\\nJuly 20, 2022\\n\\nApril 27, 2022\\n\\nFebruary 2, 2022\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nRecord Date\\n\\nMarch 3, 2023\\n\\nDecember 2, 2022\\n\\nSeptember 2, 2022\\n\\nJune 3, 2022\\n\\nMarch 4, 2022\\n\\nPayment Date\\n\\nMarch 31, 2023\\n\\nDecember 30, 2022\\n\\nSeptember 30, 2022\\n\\nJune 24, 2022\\n\\nMarch 25, 2022\\n\\nDividend\\n\\nPer Share\\n\\n$\\n\\n0.22\\n\\n0.22\\n\\n0.22\\n\\n0.21\\n\\n0.21\\n\\nIn 2022, and through February 22, 2023.\\n\\nThe cash dividends paid per share of common stock were $0.86\\n\\n$0.78 and $0.72 for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\\n\\nThe table below summarizes common stock repurchases\\n\\nduring 2022, 2021 and 2020.\\n\\nCommon Stock Repurchase Summary\\n\\n(in millions)\\n\\nTotal share repurchases, including CCAR\\n\\ncapital plan repurchases\\n\\nPurchase price of shares repurchased and\\n\\nretired (1)\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n2022\\n\\n2021\\n\\n2020\\n\\n126\\n\\n615\\n\\n227\\n\\n$ 5,073\\n\\n$ 25,126\\n\\n$ 7,025\\n\\nConsists of repurchases pursuant to the Corporation’s CCAR capital plans.\\n\\nDuring 2022, in connection with employee stock plans, the\\n\\nCorporation issued 73 million shares of its common stock and,\\n\\nto satisfy tax withholding obligations, repurchased 28 million\\n\\nshares of its common stock.

As a financial holding company,\\n\\nthe Corporation is subject to capital adequacy rules issued by\\n\\nthe Federal Reserve. The Corporation’s banking entity affiliates\\n\\nare subject to capital adequacy rules issued by the OCC.\\n\\nThe Corporation and its primary banking entity affiliate,\\n\\nBANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3. As\\n\\nAdvanced approaches institutions, the Corporation and its\\n\\nbanking entity affiliates are required to report regulatory riskbased capital ratios and risk-weighted assets under both the\\n\\nStandardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that\\n\\nyields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy,\\n\\nincluding under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework.\\n\\nThe Corporation is required to maintain a minimum\\n\\nsupplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a\\n\\nleverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain\\n\\nrestrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus\\n\\npayments.

The Corporation’s stress capital buffer applied\\n\\nin place of the capital conservation buffer under the Standardized approach was 3.4 percent at December 31, 2022 and 2.5 percent at December 31, 2021. The countercyclical capital buffer for\\n\\nboth periods was zero. The CET1 capital regulatory minimum is the sum of the CET1 capital ratio minimum of 4.5 percent, the Corporation’s G-SIB surcharge of 2.5 percent and the Corporation’s\\n\\ncapital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent or the SCB, as applicable, of 3.4 percent at December 31, 2022 and 2.5 percent at December 31, 2021. The SLR regulatory minimum includes a\\n\\nleverage buffer of 2.0 percent.\\n\\nRisk-based capital regulatory minimums at December 31, 2022 and 2021 are the minimum ratios under Basel 3, including a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent. The regulatory minimums\\n\\nfor the leverage ratios as of both period ends are the percent required to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework.\\n\\nTotal capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit\\n\\nlosses.\\n\\nReflects total average assets adjusted for certain Tier 1 capital deductions.\\n\\nBank of America 2022 187\\n\\nThe capital adequacy rules issued by the U.S. banking\\n\\nregulators require institutions to meet the established\\n\\nminimums outlined in the table above. Failure to meet the\\n\\nminimum requirements can lead to certain mandatory and\\n\\ndiscretionary actions by regulators that could have a material\\n\\nadverse impact on the Corporation’s financial position. At\\n\\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation and its banking\\n\\nentity affiliates were well capitalized.\\n\\nOther Regulatory Matters\\n\\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation had cash\\n\\nand cash equivalents in the amount of $5.6 billion and $4.0\\n\\nbillion, and securities with a fair value of $16.6 billion and\\n\\n$10.6 billion that were segregated in compliance with securities\\n\\nregulations. Cash and cash equivalents segregated in\\n\\ncompliance with securities regulations are a component of\\n\\nrestricted cash. For more information, see Note 10 – Securities\\n\\nFinancing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings, Collateral and\\n\\nRestricted Cash. In addition, at December 31, 2022 and 2021,\\n\\nthe Corporation had cash deposited with clearing organizations\\n\\nof $20.7 billion and $28.6 billion primarily recorded in other\\n\\nassets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\\n\\nBank Subsidiary Distributions\\n\\nThe primary sources of funds for cash distributions by the\\n\\nCorporation to its shareholders are capital distributions received\\n\\nfrom its bank subsidiaries, BANA and Bank of America\\n\\nCalifornia, N.A. In 2022, the Corporation received dividends of\\n\\n$22.0 billion from BANA and $250 million from Bank of America\\n\\nCalifornia, N.A.\\n\\nThe amount of dividends that a subsidiary bank may declare\\n\\nin a calendar year without OCC approval is the subsidiary bank’s\\n\\nnet profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for\\n\\nthe preceding two years. Retained net profits, as defined by the\\n\\nOCC, consist of net income less dividends declared during the\\n\\nperiod. In 2023, BANA can declare and pay dividends of\\n\\napproximately $16.1 billion to the Corporation plus an additional\\n\\namount equal to its retained net profits for 2023 up to the date\\n\\nof any such dividend declaration. Bank of America California,\\n\\nN.A. can pay dividends of $173 million in 2023 plus an\\n\\nadditional amount equal to its retained net profits for 2023 up\\n\\nto the date of any such dividend declaration.\\n\\nNOTE 17 Employee Benefit Plans\\n\\nPension and Postretirement Plans\\n\\nThe Corporation sponsors a qualified noncontributory trusteed\\n\\npension plan (Qualified Pension Plan), a number of\\n\\nnoncontributory nonqualified pension plans and postretirement\\n\\nhealth and life plans that cover eligible employees. Non-U.S.\\n\\n188 Bank of America 2022\\n\\npension plans sponsored by the Corporation vary based on the\\n\\ncountry and local practices.\\n\\nThe Qualified Pension Plan has a balance guarantee feature\\n\\nfor account balances with participant-selected investments,\\n\\napplied at the time a benefit payment is made from the plan\\n\\nthat effectively provides principal protection for participant\\n\\nbalances transferred and certain compensation credits. The\\n\\nCorporation is responsible for funding any shortfall on the\\n\\nguarantee feature.\\n\\nBenefits earned under the Qualified Pension Plan have been\\n\\nfrozen. Thereafter, the cash balance accounts continue to earn\\n\\ninvestment credits or interest credits in accordance with the\\n\\nterms of the plan document.\\n\\nThe Corporation has an annuity contract that guarantees the\\n\\npayment of benefits vested under a terminated U.S. pension\\n\\nplan (Other Pension Plan). The Corporation, under a\\n\\nsupplemental agreement, may be responsible for or benefit from\\n\\nactual experience and investment performance of the annuity\\n\\nassets. The Corporation made no contribution under this\\n\\nagreement in 2022 or 2021. Contributions may be required in\\n\\nthe future under this agreement.\\n\\nThe Corporation’s noncontributory, nonqualified pension\\n\\nplans are unfunded and provide supplemental defined pension\\n\\nbenefits to certain eligible employees.\\n\\nIn addition to retirement pension benefits, certain benefitseligible employees may become eligible to continue participation\\n\\nas retirees in health care and/or life insurance plans sponsored\\n\\nby the Corporation. These plans are referred to as the\\n\\nPostretirement Health and Life Plans.\\n\\nThe Pension and Postretirement Plans table summarizes the\\n\\nchanges in the fair value of plan assets, changes in the\\n\\nprojected benefit obligation (PBO), the funded status of both the\\n\\naccumulated benefit obligation (ABO) and the PBO, and the\\n\\nweighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit\\n\\nobligations for the pension plans and postretirement plans at\\n\\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021. The estimate of the\\n\\nCorporation’s PBO associated with these plans considers\\n\\nvarious actuarial assumptions, including assumptions for\\n\\nmortality rates and discount rates. The discount rate\\n\\nassumptions are derived from a cash flow matching technique\\n\\nthat utilizes rates that are based on Aa-rated corporate bonds\\n\\nwith cash flows that match estimated benefit payments of each\\n\\nof the plans.

The Corporation’s policy is to invest the trust\\n\\nassets in a prudent manner for the exclusive purpose of\\n\\nproviding benefits to participants and defraying reasonable\\n\\nexpenses of administration. The Corporation’s investment\\n\\nstrategy is designed to provide a total return that, over the long\\n\\nterm, increases the ratio of assets to liabilities. The strategy\\n\\nattempts to maximize the investment return on assets at a level\\n\\nof risk deemed appropriate by the Corporation while complying\\n\\nwith ERISA and any applicable regulations and laws. The\\n\\ninvestment strategy utilizes asset allocation as a principal\\n\\ndeterminant for establishing the risk/return profile of the\\n\\nassets. Asset allocation ranges are established, periodically\\n\\nreviewed and adjusted as funding levels and liability\\n\\ncharacteristics change. Active and passive investment\\n\\nmanagers are employed to help enhance the risk/return profile\\n\\nof the assets. An additional aspect of the investment strategy\\n\\nused to minimize risk (part of the asset allocation plan) includes\\n\\nmatching the exposure of participant-selected investment\\n\\nmeasures.\\n\\nThe assets of the Non-U.S. Pension Plans are primarily\\n\\nattributable to a U.K. pension plan. This U.K. pension plan’s\\n\\nassets are invested prudently so that the benefits promised to\\n\\nmembers are provided with consideration given to the nature\\n\\nand the duration of the plans’ liabilities. The selected asset\\n\\nallocation strategy is designed to achieve a higher return than\\n\\nthe lowest risk strategy.\\n\\nThe expected rate of return on plan assets assumption was\\n\\ndeveloped through analysis of historical market returns,\\n\\nhistorical asset class volatility and correlations, current market\\n\\nconditions, anticipated future asset allocations, the funds’ past\\n\\nexperience and expectations on potential future market returns.\\n\\nThe expected return on plan assets assumption is determined\\n\\nusing the calculated market-related value for the Qualified\\n\\nPension Plan and the Other Pension Plan and the fair value for\\n\\nthe Non-U.S. Pension Plans and Postretirement Health and Life\\n\\nPlans. The expected return on plan assets assumption\\n\\nrepresents a long-term average view of the performance of the\\n\\nassets in the Qualified Pension Plan, the Non-U.S. Pension\\n\\nPlans, the Other Pension Plan, and Postretirement Health and\\n\\nLife Plans, a return that may or may not be achieved during any\\n\\none calendar year.

Under this plan,\\n\\n715 million shares of the Corporation’s common stock are\\n\\nauthorized to be used for grants of awards.\\n\\nDuring 2022 and 2021, the Corporation granted 102 million\\n\\nand 99 million RSU awards to certain employees under the\\n\\nBACEP. These RSUs were authorized to settle predominantly in\\n\\nshares of common stock of the Corporation. Certain RSUs will\\n\\nbe settled in cash or contain settlement provisions that subject\\n\\nthese awards to variable accounting whereby compensation\\n\\nexpense is adjusted to fair value based on changes in the share\\n\\nprice of the Corporation’s common stock up to the settlement\\n\\ndate. The RSUs granted in 2022 will generally vest over four\\n\\nyears. Of the RSUs granted in 2021, 81 million will generally\\n\\nvest over four years and 18 million will vest over three years.\\n\\nThe four-year awards vest primarily in one-fourth increments on\\n\\neach of the first four anniversaries of the grant date while the\\n\\nthree-year awards vest primarily in one-third increments on each\\n\\nof the first three anniversaries of the grant date, provided that\\n\\nthe employee remains continuously employed with the\\n\\nCorporation during that time, and will be expensed ratably over\\n\\nthe vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures, for nonretirement eligible employees based on the grant-date fair value\\n\\nof the shares. Of the RSUs granted in 2022 and 2021 that vest\\n\\nover four years, 39 million and 27 million do not include\\n\\nretirement eligibility. For all other RSUs granted to employees\\n\\nwho are retirement eligible, they are deemed authorized as of\\n\\nthe beginning of the year preceding the grant date when the\\n\\nincentive award plans are generally approved. As a result, the\\n\\nestimated value is expensed ratably over the year preceding the\\n\\ngrant date. The compensation cost for the stock-based plans\\n\\nwas $2.9 billion, $3.0 billion and $2.1 billion, and the related\\n\\nincome tax benefit was $697 million, $723 million and $505\\n\\nmillion for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

However, a material change in those estimates could\\n\\nlead management to reassess such valuation allowance\\n\\nconclusions.\\n\\nAt December 31, 2022, U.S. federal income taxes had not\\n\\nbeen provided on approximately $5.0 billion of temporary\\n\\ndifferences associated with investments in non-U.S.\\n\\nsubsidiaries that are essentially permanent in duration. If the\\n\\nCorporation were to record the associated deferred tax liability,\\n\\nthe amount would be approximately $1.0 billion.\\n\\nUnder applicable accounting standards, fair value is defined as\\n\\nthe exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid\\n\\nto transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most\\n\\nadvantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly\\n\\ntransaction between market participants on the measurement\\n\\ndate. The Corporation determines the fair values of its financial\\n\\ninstruments under applicable accounting standards that require\\n\\nan entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize\\n\\nthe use of unobservable inputs. The Corporation categorizes its\\n\\nfinancial instruments into three levels based on the established\\n\\nfair value hierarchy and conducts a review of fair value hierarchy\\n\\nclassifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of fair\\n\\nvalue hierarchy classifications are made if the significant inputs\\n\\nused in the financial models measuring the fair values of the\\n\\nassets and liabilities become unobservable or observable in the\\n\\ncurrent marketplace. For more information regarding the fair\\n\\nvalue hierarchy and how the Corporation measures fair value,\\n\\nsee Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles. The\\n\\nCorporation accounts for certain financial instruments under the\\n\\nfair value option. For more information, see Note 21 – Fair Value\\n\\nOption.\\n\\nValuation Techniques\\n\\nThe following sections outline the valuation methodologies for\\n\\nthe Corporation’s assets and liabilities. While the Corporation\\n\\nbelieves its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent\\n\\nwith other market participants, the use of different\\n\\nmethodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of\\n\\ncertain financial instruments could result in a different estimate\\n\\nof fair value at the reporting date.\\n\\nDuring 2022, there were no significant changes to valuation\\n\\napproaches or techniques that had, or are expected to have, a\\n\\nmaterial impact on the Corporation’s consolidated financial\\n\\nposition or results of operations.\\n\\nTrading Account Assets and Liabilities and Debt Securities\\n\\nThe fair values of trading account assets and liabilities are\\n\\nprimarily based on actively traded markets where prices are\\n\\nbased on either direct market quotes or observed transactions.\\n\\nThe fair values of debt securities are generally based on quoted\\n\\nmarket prices or market prices for similar assets. Liquidity is a\\n\\nsignificant factor in the determination of the fair values of\\n\\ntrading account assets and liabilities and debt securities.\\n\\nMarket price quotes may not be readily available for some\\n\\npositions such as positions within a market sector where\\n\\ntrading activity has slowed significantly or ceased. Some of\\n\\nthese instruments are valued using a discounted cash flow\\n\\nmodel, which estimates the fair value of the securities using\\n\\ninternal credit risk, and interest rate and prepayment risk\\n\\nmodels that incorporate management’s best estimate of current\\n\\nkey assumptions such as default rates, loss severity and\\n\\nprepayment rates. Principal and interest cash flows are\\n\\ndiscounted using an observable discount rate for similar\\n\\ninstruments with adjustments that management believes a\\n\\nmarket participant would consider in determining fair value for\\n\\nthe specific security. Other instruments are valued using a net\\n\\nasset value approach which considers the value of the\\n\\nunderlying securities. Underlying assets are valued using\\n\\nexternal pricing services, where available, or matrix pricing\\n\\nbased on the vintages and ratings. Situations of illiquidity\\n\\ngenerally are triggered by the market’s perception of credit\\n\\nuncertainty regarding a single company or a specific market\\n\\nsector. In these instances, fair value is determined based on\\n\\nlimited available market information and other factors,\\n\\nBank of America 2022 195\\n\\nprincipally from reviewing the issuer’s financial statements and\\n\\nchanges in credit ratings made by one or more rating agencies.\\n\\nDerivative Assets and Liabilities\\n\\nThe fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in the\\n\\nOTC market are determined using quantitative models that\\n\\nutilize multiple market inputs including interest rates, prices and\\n\\nindices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and\\n\\nvolatility factors to value the position. The majority of market\\n\\ninputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external\\n\\nsources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party\\n\\npricing services. When third-party pricing services are used, the\\n\\nmethods and assumptions are reviewed by the Corporation.\\n\\nEstimation risk is greater for derivative asset and liability\\n\\npositions that are either option-based or have longer maturity\\n\\ndates where observable market inputs are less readily available,\\n\\nor are unobservable, in which case, quantitative-based\\n\\nextrapolations of rate, price or index scenarios are used in\\n\\ndetermining fair values. The fair values of derivative assets and\\n\\nliabilities include adjustments for market liquidity, counterparty\\n\\ncredit quality and other instrument-specific factors, where\\n\\nappropriate. In addition, the Corporation incorporates within its\\n\\nfair value measurements of OTC derivatives a valuation\\n\\nadjustment to reflect the credit risk associated with the net\\n\\nposition. Positions are netted by counterparty, and fair value for\\n\\nnet long exposures is adjusted for counterparty credit risk while\\n\\nthe fair value for net short exposures is adjusted for the\\n\\nCorporation’s own credit risk. The Corporation also incorporates\\n\\nFVA within its fair value measurements to include funding costs\\n\\non uncollateralized derivatives and derivatives where the\\n\\nCorporation is not permitted to use the collateral it receives. An\\n\\nestimate of severity of loss is also used in the determination of\\n\\nfair value, primarily based on market data.\\n\\nLoans and Loan Commitments\\n\\nThe fair values of loans and loan commitments are based on\\n\\nmarket prices, where available, or discounted cash flow\\n\\nanalyses using market-based credit spreads of comparable debt\\n\\ninstruments or credit derivatives of the specific borrower or\\n\\ncomparable borrowers. Results of discounted cash flow\\n\\nanalyses may be adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect other\\n\\nmarket conditions or the perceived credit risk of the borrower.\\n\\nMortgage Servicing Rights\\n\\nThe fair values of MSRs are primarily determined using an\\n\\noption-adjusted spread valuation approach, which factors in\\n\\nprepayment risk to determine the fair value of MSRs. This\\n\\napproach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under\\n\\nmultiple interest rate scenarios and discounting these cash\\n\\nflows using risk-adjusted discount rates.\\n\\n196 Bank of America 2022\\n\\nLoans Held-for-sale\\n\\nThe fair values of LHFS are based on quoted market prices,\\n\\nwhere available, or are determined by discounting estimated\\n\\ncash flows using interest rates approximating the Corporation’s\\n\\ncurrent origination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect the\\n\\ninherent credit risk. The borrower-specific credit risk is\\n\\nembedded within the quoted market prices or is implied by\\n\\nconsidering loan performance when selecting comparables.\\n\\nShort-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt\\n\\nThe Corporation issues structured liabilities that have coupons\\n\\nor repayment terms linked to the performance of debt or equity\\n\\nsecurities, interest rates, indices, currencies or commodities.\\n\\nThe fair values of these structured liabilities are estimated using\\n\\nquantitative models for the combined derivative and debt\\n\\nportions of the notes. These models incorporate observable\\n\\nand, in some instances, unobservable inputs including security\\n\\nprices, interest rate yield curves, option volatility, currency,\\n\\ncommodity or equity rates and correlations among these inputs.\\n\\nThe Corporation also considers the impact of its own credit\\n\\nspread in determining the discount rate used to value these\\n\\nliabilities. The credit spread is determined by reference to\\n\\nobservable spreads in the secondary bond market.\\n\\nSecurities Financing Agreements\\n\\nThe fair values of certain reverse repurchase agreements,\\n\\nrepurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions\\n\\nare determined using quantitative models, including discounted\\n\\ncash flow models that require the use of multiple market inputs\\n\\nincluding interest rates and spreads to generate continuous\\n\\nyield or pricing curves, and volatility factors. The majority of\\n\\nmarket inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through\\n\\nexternal sources, including brokers, market transactions and\\n\\nthird-party pricing services.\\n\\nDeposits\\n\\nThe fair values of deposits are determined using quantitative\\n\\nmodels, including discounted cash flow models that require the\\n\\nuse of multiple market inputs including interest rates and\\n\\nspreads to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, and\\n\\nvolatility factors. The majority of market inputs are actively\\n\\nquoted and can be validated through external sources, including\\n\\nbrokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services.\\n\\nThe Corporation considers the impact of its own credit spread in\\n\\nthe valuation of these liabilities. The credit risk is determined by\\n\\nreference to observable credit spreads in the secondary cash\\n\\nmarket.\\n\\nAsset-backed Secured Financings\\n\\nThe fair values of asset-backed secured financings are based on\\n\\nexternal broker bids, where available, or are determined by\\n\\ndiscounting estimated cash flows using interest rates\\n\\napproximating the Corporation’s current origination rates for\\n\\nsimilar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk.\\n\\nRecurring Fair Value\\n\\nAssets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2022 and 2021, including financial instruments that\\n\\nthe Corporation accounts for under the fair value option, are summarized in the following tables.\\n\\nDecember 31, 2022\\n\\nFair Value Measurements\\n\\nLevel 1\\n\\n(Dollars in millions)\\n\\nAssets\\n\\nTime deposits placed and other short-term investments\\n\\n$\\n\\nFederal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under\\n\\nagreements to resell\\n\\nTrading account assets:\\n\\nU.S. Treasury and government agencies\\n\\nCorporate securities, trading loans and other\\n\\nEquity securities\\n\\nNon-U.S. sovereign debt\\n\\nMortgage trading loans, MBS and ABS:\\n\\nU.S. government-sponsored agency guaranteed\\n\\nMortgage trading loans, ABS and other MBS\\n\\nTotal trading account assets (2)\\n\\nDerivative assets\\n\\nAFS debt securities:\\n\\nU.S. Treasury and government agencies\\n\\nMortgage-backed securities:\\n\\nAgency\\n\\nAgency-collateralized mortgage obligations\\n\\nNon-agency residential\\n\\nCommercial\\n\\nNon-U.S. securities\\n\\nOther taxable securities\\n\\nTax-exempt securities\\n\\nTotal AFS debt securities\\n\\nOther debt securities carried at fair value:\\n\\nU.S. Treasury and government agencies\\n\\nNon-agency residential MBS\\n\\nNon-U.S. and other securities\\n\\nTotal other debt securities carried at fair value\\n\\nLoans and leases\\n\\nLoans held-for-sale\\n\\nOther assets (3)\\n\\nTotal assets (4)\\n\\nLiabilities\\n\\nInterest-bearing deposits in U.S. offices\\n\\nFederal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under\\n\\nagreements to repurchase\\n\\nTrading account liabilities:\\n\\nU.S. Treasury and government agencies\\n\\nEquity securities\\n\\nNon-U.S. sovereign debt\\n\\nCorporate securities and other\\n\\nTotal trading account liabilities\\n\\nDerivative liabilities\\n\\nShort-term borrowings\\n\\nAccrued expenses and other liabilities\\n\\nLong-term debt\\n\\nTotal liabilities (4)\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n(2)\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n(4)\\n\\nLevel 2\\n\\n868\\n\\n$\\n\\nNetting\\n\\nAdjustments (1)\\n\\nLevel 3\\n\\n—\\n\\n$\\n\\n—\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n868\\n\\n—\\n\\n146,999\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n146,999\\n\\n58,894\\n\\n—\\n\\n77,868\\n\\n7,392\\n\\n212\\n\\n46,897\\n\\n35,065\\n\\n26,306\\n\\n—\\n\\n2,384\\n\\n145\\n\\n518\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n59,106\\n\\n49,281\\n\\n113,078\\n\\n34,216\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n28,563\\n\\n10,312\\n\\n34\\n\\n1,518\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n28,597\\n\\n11,830\\n\\n144,154\\n\\n14,775\\n\\n147,355\\n\\n380,380\\n\\n4,599\\n\\n3,213\\n\\n158,102\\n\\n920\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n159,022\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n158,102\\n\\n23,442\\n\\n2,221\\n\\n128\\n\\n6,407\\n\\n13,212\\n\\n4,645\\n\\n11,207\\n\\n62,182\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n258\\n\\n—\\n\\n195\\n\\n—\\n\\n51\\n\\n504\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n23,442\\n\\n2,221\\n\\n386\\n\\n6,407\\n\\n13,407\\n\\n4,645\\n\\n11,258\\n\\n220,788\\n\\n561\\n\\n—\\n\\n3,027\\n\\n3,588\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n6,898\\n\\n—\\n\\n248\\n\\n5,251\\n\\n5,499\\n\\n5,518\\n\\n883\\n\\n897\\n\\n—\\n\\n119\\n\\n—\\n\\n119\\n\\n253\\n\\n232\\n\\n1,799\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n561\\n\\n367\\n\\n8,278\\n\\n9,206\\n\\n5,771\\n\\n1,115\\n\\n9,594\\n\\n—\\n\\n(349,726)\\n\\n$\\n\\n328,385\\n\\n$\\n\\n749,713\\n\\n$\\n\\n10,719\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n—\\n\\n$\\n\\n311\\n\\n$\\n\\n—\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n—\\n\\nAssets/Liabilities\\n\\nat Fair Value\\n\\n—\\n\\n151,708\\n\\n—\\n\\n13,906\\n\\n36,937\\n\\n9,636\\n\\n—\\n\\n60,479\\n\\n15,431\\n\\n—\\n\\n7,458\\n\\n—\\n\\n181\\n\\n4,825\\n\\n8,228\\n\\n6,628\\n\\n19,862\\n\\n376,979\\n\\n818\\n\\n2,262\\n\\n32,208\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n58\\n\\n58\\n\\n6,106\\n\\n14\\n\\n32\\n\\n862\\n\\n83,368\\n\\n$\\n\\n584,148\\n\\n$\\n\\n7,072\\n\\n(349,726)\\n\\n—\\n\\n296,108\\n\\n48,642\\n\\n$\\n\\n739,091\\n\\n$\\n\\n311\\n\\n—\\n\\n151,708\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n(353,700)\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n$\\n\\n(353,700)\\n\\n14,087\\n\\n41,762\\n\\n17,864\\n\\n6,686\\n\\n80,399\\n\\n44,816\\n\\n832\\n\\n9,752\\n\\n33,070\\n\\n$\\n\\n320,888\\n\\nAmounts represent the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements and also cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparties.\\n\\nIncludes securities with a fair value of $16.6 billion that were segregated in compliance with securities regulations or deposited with clearing organizations.

Structured liabilities primarily include equitylinked notes that are accounted for under the fair value option.\\n\\nThe Corporation uses multiple market approaches in valuing\\n\\ncertain of its Level 3 financial instruments. For example, market\\n\\ncomparables and discounted cash flows are used together. For\\n\\na given product, such as corporate debt securities, market\\n\\ncomparables may be used to estimate some of the\\n\\nunobservable inputs, and then these inputs are incorporated\\n\\ninto a discounted cash flow model. Therefore, the balances\\n\\ndisclosed encompass both of these techniques.\\n\\nThe levels of aggregation and diversity within the products\\n\\ndisclosed in the tables result in certain ranges of inputs being\\n\\nwide and unevenly distributed across asset and liability\\n\\ncategories.\\n\\nUncertainty of Fair Value Measurements from\\n\\nUnobservable Inputs\\n\\nLoans and Securities\\n\\nA significant increase in market yields, default rates, loss\\n\\nseverities or duration would have resulted in a significantly lower\\n\\nfair value for long positions. Short positions would have been\\n\\nimpacted in a directionally opposite way. The impact of changes\\n\\nin prepayment speeds would have resulted in differing impacts\\n\\ndepending on the seniority of the instrument and, in the case of\\n\\nCLOs, whether prepayments can be reinvested. A significant\\n\\nincrease in price would have resulted in a significantly higher\\n\\nfair value for long positions, and short positions would have\\n\\nbeen impacted in a directionally opposite way.\\n\\nStructured Liabilities and Derivatives\\n\\nFor credit derivatives, a significant increase in market yield,\\n\\nupfront points (i.e., a single upfront payment made by a\\n\\nprotection buyer at inception), credit spreads, default rates or\\n\\nloss severities would have resulted in a significantly lower fair\\n\\nvalue for protection sellers and higher fair value for protection\\n\\nbuyers. The impact of changes in prepayment speeds would\\n\\nhave resulted in differing impacts depending on the seniority of\\n\\nthe instrument.\\n\\nStructured credit derivatives are impacted by credit\\n\\ncorrelation. Default correlation is a parameter that describes the\\n\\ndegree of dependence among credit default rates within a credit\\n\\nportfolio that underlies a credit derivative instrument. The\\n\\nsensitivity of this input on the fair value varies depending on the\\n\\nlevel of subordination of the tranche. For senior tranches that\\n\\nare net purchases of protection, a significant increase in default\\n\\ncorrelation would have resulted in a significantly higher fair\\n\\nvalue. Net short protection positions would have been impacted\\n\\nin a directionally opposite way.\\n\\nFor equity derivatives, commodity derivatives, interest rate\\n\\nderivatives and structured liabilities, a significant change in\\n\\nlong-dated rates and volatilities and correlation inputs (i.e., the\\n\\ndegree of correlation between an equity security and an index,\\n\\nbetween two different commodities, between two different\\n\\ninterest rates, or between interest rates and foreign exchange\\n\\nrates) would have resulted in a significant impact to the fair\\n\\nvalue; however, the magnitude and direction of the impact\\n\\ndepend on whether the Corporation is long or short the\\n\\nexposure. For structured liabilities, a significant increase in yield\\n\\nor decrease in price would have resulted in a significantly lower\\n\\nfair value.\\n\\nNonrecurring Fair Value\\n\\nThe Corporation holds certain assets that are measured at fair\\n\\nvalue only in certain situations (e.g., the impairment of an\\n\\nasset), and these measurements are referred to herein as\\n\\nnonrecurring.

These\\n\\ncredit derivatives do not meet the requirements for designation\\n\\nas accounting hedges and are carried at fair value. The fair\\n\\nvalue option allows the Corporation to carry these loans and\\n\\nloan commitments at fair value, which is more consistent with\\n\\nmanagement’s view of the underlying economics and the\\n\\nmanner in which they are managed. In addition, the fair value\\n\\noption allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility\\n\\nthat would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by\\n\\naccounting for the financial instruments at historical cost and\\n\\nthe credit derivatives at fair value.\\n\\nLoans Held-for-sale\\n\\nThe Corporation elects to account for residential mortgage\\n\\nLHFS, commercial mortgage LHFS and certain other LHFS under\\n\\nthe fair value option. These loans are actively managed and\\n\\nmonitored and, as appropriate, certain market risks of the loans\\n\\nmay be mitigated through the use of derivatives. The\\n\\nCorporation has elected not to designate the derivatives as\\n\\nqualifying accounting hedges, and therefore, they are carried at\\n\\n204 Bank of America 2022\\n\\nfair value. The changes in fair value of the loans are largely\\n\\noffset by changes in the fair value of the derivatives. The fair\\n\\nvalue option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting\\n\\nvolatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created\\n\\nby accounting for the financial instruments at the lower of cost\\n\\nor fair value and the derivatives at fair value. The Corporation\\n\\nhas not elected to account for certain other LHFS under the fair\\n\\nvalue option primarily because these loans are floating-rate\\n\\nloans that are not hedged using derivative instruments.\\n\\nLoans Reported as Trading Account Assets\\n\\nThe Corporation elects to account for certain loans that are held\\n\\nfor the purpose of trading and are risk-managed on a fair value\\n\\nbasis under the fair value option.\\n\\nOther Assets\\n\\nThe Corporation elects to account for certain long-term fixed-rate\\n\\nmargin loans that are hedged with derivatives under the fair\\n\\nvalue option.

These elections include\\n\\ncertain agreements collateralized by the U.S. government and\\n\\nits agencies, which are generally short-dated and have minimal\\n\\ninterest rate risk.\\n\\nLong-term Deposits\\n\\nThe Corporation elects to account for certain long-term fixed-rate\\n\\nand rate-linked deposits that are hedged with derivatives that do\\n\\nnot qualify for hedge accounting. Election of the fair value option\\n\\nallows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that\\n\\nwould otherwise result from the asymmetry created by\\n\\naccounting for the financial instruments at historical cost and\\n\\nthe derivatives at fair value. The Corporation has not elected to\\n\\ncarry other long-term deposits at fair value because they are not\\n\\nhedged using derivatives.\\n\\nvolatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created\\n\\nby accounting for the asset-backed secured financings at\\n\\nhistorical cost and the corresponding mortgage LHFS securing\\n\\nthese financings at fair value.\\n\\nLong-term Debt\\n\\nThe Corporation elects to account for certain long-term debt,\\n\\nprimarily structured liabilities, under the fair value option.

For more information on commitments, see Note 12 – Commitments and\\n\\nContingencies.\\n\\nNOTE 23 Business Segment Information\\n\\nThe Corporation reports its results of operations through the\\n\\nfollowing four business segments: Consumer Banking, Global\\n\\nWealth & Investment Management, Global Banking and Global\\n\\nMarkets, with the remaining operations recorded in All Other.\\n\\nConsumer Banking\\n\\nConsumer Banking offers a diversified range of credit, banking\\n\\nand investment products and services to consumers and small\\n\\nbusinesses. Consumer Banking product offerings include\\n\\ntraditional savings accounts, money market savings accounts,\\n\\nCDs and IRAs, checking accounts, and investment accounts and\\n\\nproducts, as well as credit and debit cards, residential\\n\\nmortgages and home equity loans, and direct and indirect loans\\n\\nto consumers and small businesses in the U.S. Consumer\\n\\nBanking includes the impact of servicing residential mortgages\\n\\nand home equity loans.\\n\\nGlobal Wealth & Investment Management\\n\\nGWIM provides a high-touch client experience through a network\\n\\nof financial advisors focused on clients with over $250,000 in\\n\\ntotal investable assets, including tailored solutions to meet\\n\\nclients’ needs through a full set of investment management,\\n\\nbrokerage, banking and retirement products. GWIM also\\n\\nprovides comprehensive wealth management solutions targeted\\n\\nto high net worth and ultra high net worth clients, as well as\\n\\ncustomized solutions to meet clients’ wealth structuring,\\n\\ninvestment management, trust and banking needs, including\\n\\nspecialty asset management services.\\n\\nGlobal Banking provides a wide range of lending-related products\\n\\nand services, integrated working capital management and\\n\\ntreasury solutions, and underwriting and advisory services\\n\\nthrough the Corporation’s network of offices and client\\n\\nrelationship teams. Global Banking also provides investment\\n\\nbanking products to clients. The economics of certain\\n\\ninvestment banking and underwriting activities are shared\\n\\nprimarily between Global Banking and Global Markets under an\\n\\ninternal revenue-sharing arrangement. Global Banking clients\\n\\ngenerally include middle-market companies, commercial real\\n\\nestate firms, not-for-profit companies, large global corporations,\\n\\nfinancial institutions, leasing clients, and mid-sized U.S.-based\\n\\nbusinesses requiring customized and integrated financial advice\\n\\nand solutions.\\n\\nGlobal Markets\\n\\nGlobal Markets offers sales and trading services and research\\n\\nservices to institutional clients across fixed-income, credit,\\n\\ncurrency, commodity and equity businesses. Global Markets\\n\\nprovides market-making, financing, securities clearing,\\n\\nsettlement and custody services globally to institutional investor\\n\\nclients in support of their investing and trading activities. Global\\n\\nMarkets product coverage includes securities and derivative\\n\\nproducts in both the primary and secondary markets. Global\\n\\nMarkets also works with commercial and corporate clients to\\n\\nprovide risk management products. As a result of marketmaking activities, Global Markets may be required to manage\\n\\nrisk in a broad range of financial products. In addition, the\\n\\neconomics of certain investment banking and underwriting\\n\\nactivities are shared primarily between Global Markets and\\n\\nGlobal Banking under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement.\\n\\nAll Other\\n\\nAll Other primarily consists of ALM activities, liquidating\\n\\nbusinesses and certain expenses not otherwise allocated to a\\n\\nbusiness segment. ALM activities encompass interest rate and\\n\\nforeign currency risk management activities for which\\n\\nsubstantially all of the results are allocated to the business\\n\\nsegments.\\n\\nBasis of Presentation\\n\\nThe management accounting and reporting process derives\\n\\nsegment and business results by utilizing allocation\\n\\nmethodologies for revenue and expense. The net income\\n\\nderived for the businesses is dependent upon revenue and cost\\n\\nallocations using an activity-based costing model, funds transfer\\n\\npricing, and other methodologies and assumptions management\\n\\nbelieves are appropriate to reflect the results of the business.\\n\\nTotal revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest\\n\\nincome on an FTE basis and noninterest income. The\\n\\nadjustment of net interest income to an FTE basis results in a\\n\\ncorresponding increase in income tax expense. The segment\\n\\nresults also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies\\n\\nthat are utilized to determine net income. The net interest\\n\\nincome of the businesses includes the results of a funds\\n\\ntransfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with\\n\\nsimilar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. In\\n\\nsegments where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds\\n\\nassets, which are generally deposit-taking segments, the\\n\\nCorporation allocates assets to match liabilities. Net interest\\n\\nincome of the business segments also includes an allocation of\\n\\nnet interest income generated by certain of the Corporation’s\\n\\nALM activities.\\n\\nThe Corporation’s ALM activities include an overall interest\\n\\nrate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of\\n\\nBank of America 2022 207\\n\\nvarious derivatives and cash instruments to manage\\n\\nfluctuations in earnings and capital that are caused by interest\\n\\nrate volatility. The Corporation’s goal is to manage interest rate\\n\\nsensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not\\n\\nsignificantly adversely affect earnings and capital. The results of\\n\\na majority of the Corporation’s ALM activities are allocated to\\n\\nthe business segments and fluctuate based on the performance\\n\\nof the ALM activities. ALM activities include external product\\n\\npricing decisions including deposit pricing strategies, the effects\\n\\nof the Corporation’s internal funds transfer pricing process and\\n\\nthe net effects of other ALM activities.\\n\\nCertain expenses not directly attributable to a specific\\n\\nbusiness segment are allocated to the segments. The costs of\\n\\ncertain centralized or shared functions are allocated based on\\n\\nmethodologies that reflect utilization.\\n\\nEffective October 1, 2021, a business activity previously\\n\\nincluded in the Global Markets segment is being reported as a\\n\\nliquidating business in All Other, consistent with a realignment\\n\\nin performance reporting to senior management. While this\\n\\nactivity was not material to Global Markets’ results of operations\\n\\nand historical results have not been restated, this activity’s\\n\\nnoninterest expense of $309 million and $473 million for the\\n\\nthree months ended September 30, 2021 and June 30, 2021\\n\\nwas elevated and would have been excluded from Global\\n\\nMarkets’ results of operations for those periods under the new\\n\\nbasis of presentation.\\n\\nThe table below presents net income (loss) and the\\n\\ncomponents thereto (with net interest income on an FTE basis\\n\\nfor the business segments, All Other and the total Corporation)\\n\\nfor 2022, 2021 and 2020, and total assets at December 31,\\n\\n2022, 2021 and 2020 for each business segment, as well as\\n\\nAll Other.\\n\\nResults of Business Segments and All Other\\n\\nNet interest income\\n\\nNoninterest income\\n\\nTotal revenue, net of interest expense\\n\\nProvision for credit losses\\n\\nNoninterest expense\\n\\nIncome before income taxes\\n\\nIncome tax expense\\n\\nNet income\\n\\nYear-end total assets\\n\\nTotal Corporation (1)\\n\\n2021\\n\\n2022\\n\\n43,361 $\\n\\n$\\n\\n52,900 $\\n\\n46,179\\n\\n42,488\\n\\n89,540\\n\\n95,388\\n\\n(4,594)\\n\\n2,543\\n\\n59,731\\n\\n61,438\\n\\n34,403\\n\\n31,407\\n\\n2,425\\n\\n3,879\\n\\n31,978 $\\n\\n$\\n\\n27,528 $\\n\\n$ 3,051,375 $ 3,169,495\\n\\nNet interest income\\n\\nNoninterest income\\n\\nTotal revenue, net of interest expense\\n\\nProvision for credit losses\\n\\nNoninterest expense\\n\\nIncome before income taxes\\n\\nIncome tax expense\\n\\nNet income\\n\\nYear-end total assets\\n\\nGlobal Wealth & Investment Management\\n\\n2021\\n\\n2020\\n\\n2022\\n\\n5,664 $\\n\\n5,468\\n\\n$\\n\\n7,466 $\\n\\n13,116\\n\\n15,084\\n\\n14,282\\n\\n20,748\\n\\n18,584\\n\\n21,748\\n\\n(241)\\n\\n357\\n\\n66\\n\\n15,258\\n\\n14,160\\n\\n15,490\\n\\n5,731\\n\\n4,067\\n\\n6,192\\n\\n1,404\\n\\n996\\n\\n1,517\\n\\n4,327 $\\n\\n3,071\\n\\n$\\n\\n4,675 $\\n\\n438,275\\n\\n$\\n\\n368,893 $\\n\\nAt and for the year ended December 31\\n\\n(Dollars in millions)\\n\\nNet interest income\\n\\nNoninterest income\\n\\nTotal revenue, net of interest expense\\n\\nProvision for credit losses\\n\\nNoninterest expense\\n\\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\\n\\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\\n\\nNet income (loss)\\n\\nYear-end total assets\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nThere were no material intersegment revenues.\\n\\n208 Bank of America 2022\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n2022\\n\\n3,088\\n\\n15,050\\n\\n18,138\\n\\n28\\n\\n12,420\\n\\n5,690\\n\\n1,508\\n\\n4,182\\n\\n812,489\\n\\nGlobal Markets\\n\\n2021\\n\\n$\\n\\n4,011\\n\\n15,244\\n\\n19,255\\n\\n65\\n\\n13,032\\n\\n6,158\\n\\n1,601\\n\\n$\\n\\n4,557\\n\\n$\\n\\n747,794\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n2020\\n\\n43,859\\n\\n42,168\\n\\n86,027\\n\\n11,320\\n\\n55,213\\n\\n19,494\\n\\n1,600\\n\\n17,894\\n\\n2020\\n\\n4,646\\n\\n14,119\\n\\n18,765\\n\\n251\\n\\n11,417\\n\\n7,097\\n\\n1,845\\n\\n5,252\\n\\n2022\\n\\n$\\n\\n30,045\\n\\n8,590\\n\\n38,635\\n\\n1,980\\n\\n20,077\\n\\n16,578\\n\\n4,062\\n\\n$\\n\\n12,516\\n\\n$ 1,126,453\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\nConsumer Banking\\n\\n2021\\n\\n$\\n\\n24,929 $\\n\\n9,076\\n\\n34,005\\n\\n(1,035)\\n\\n19,290\\n\\n15,750\\n\\n3,859\\n\\n$\\n\\n11,891 $\\n\\n$ 1,131,142\\n\\n2022\\n\\n12,184\\n\\n10,045\\n\\n22,229\\n\\n641\\n\\n10,966\\n\\n10,622\\n\\n2,815\\n\\n7,807\\n\\n588,466\\n\\n2022\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n117\\n\\n(5,479)\\n\\n(5,362)\\n\\n(172)\\n\\n2,485\\n\\n(7,675)\\n\\n(6,023)\\n\\n(1,652)\\n\\n155,074\\n\\nGlobal Banking\\n\\n2021\\n\\n$\\n\\n8,511\\n\\n12,364\\n\\n20,875\\n\\n(3,201)\\n\\n10,632\\n\\n13,444\\n\\n3,630\\n\\n$\\n\\n9,814\\n\\n$\\n\\n638,131\\n\\nAll Other\\n\\n2021\\n\\n$\\n\\n246\\n\\n(5,589)\\n\\n(5,343)\\n\\n(182)\\n\\n1,519\\n\\n(6,680)\\n\\n(8,069)\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,389\\n\\n$\\n\\n214,153\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n2020\\n\\n24,698\\n\\n8,564\\n\\n33,262\\n\\n5,765\\n\\n18,882\\n\\n8,615\\n\\n2,111\\n\\n6,504\\n\\n2020\\n\\n9,013\\n\\n9,974\\n\\n18,987\\n\\n4,897\\n\\n9,342\\n\\n4,748\\n\\n1,282\\n\\n3,466\\n\\n2020\\n\\n$\\n\\n$\\n\\n34\\n\\n(3,605)\\n\\n(3,571)\\n\\n50\\n\\n1,412\\n\\n(5,033)\\n\\n(4,634)\\n\\n(399)\\n\\nThe tables below present noninterest income and the associated components for 2022, 2021 and 2020 for each business\\n\\nsegment, All Other and the total Corporation.
